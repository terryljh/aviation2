# Proposal, KPI's, stakeholders, datasets

## Datasets

- Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) online database: https://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/search/database.html
- National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) aviation accident database https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/AviationQueryv2.aspx
- Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) https://www.faa.gov/data_research/accident_incident

## KPI's
- Identify trends in how aviation safety has evolved over time and explore the causes of these trends,
- Identify interventions that could improve aviation safety.
- Gain insights into aviation accidents in 2024-2025 compared to previous years. Broadly, the goal is to develop a model that either:
  - Rejects the null hypothesis that air travel safety in 2024-2025 is comparable to previous years, or
  - Does not reject the null hypothesis, but after a more refined analysis, successfully explains the discrepancy between public perception of air travel safety versus the actual data. For instance, the ASRS allows database searches to restrict to certain incident types, such as those related to air traffic controllers (ATC), and it may be that such incidents receive more media coverage than other types. 

## Stakeholders

- Passengers
- Policymakers and government officials
- Airlines and aircraft operators
