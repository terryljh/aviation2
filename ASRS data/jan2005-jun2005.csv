APCHING PHD; CEILINGS BEGAN TO THICKEN AND FORWARD VISIBILITY BEGAN TO DECREASE; HOWEVER SLANT VISIBILITY TO THE GND REMAINED GOOD. APPROX 6 NM FROM PHD; AKRON APCH CANCELED RADAR SVCS. I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO SQUAWK CODE 1200 AND ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT PHD UNICOM ON 122.8 FOR ARPT ADVISORIES. A CHEROKEE ON THE GND RPTED THE ACTIVE RWY AS RWY 32; AND I ANNOUNCED I WOULD ENTER A R UPWIND FOR RWY 32 ONCE I MADE VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE FIELD. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; VISUAL CONDITIONS BELOW CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY -- FIRST A FEW LOW PASSING CLOUDS; AND THEN ZERO VISIBILITY BELOW. 2 ACFT PREPARING TO DEPART RWY 32 WERE ADVISED BY ANOTHER ACFT OF SOME LOW CLOUDS W OF THE ARPT. AT 3 NM E OF PHD; I BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE TOTAL IMMERSION IN IMC. MY ALT WAS BTWN 2500-3000 FT MSL. I IMMEDIATELY INITIATED A 180 DEG TURN FROM A HDG OF 300 DEGS TO 120 DEGS. SIMULTANEOUSLY; I RE-CONTACTED AKRON APCH AND 1) ADVISED THEM OF BEING UNABLE TO LAND AT PHD DUE TO IMC; 2) ASKED THEM TO CLOSE MY ACTIVE VFR FLT PLAN; AND 3) ASKED THEM FOR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE IN FILING AN IFR FLT PLAN FOR A RETURN TO AGC. I HAD HOPED FOR AN IMMEDIATE SQUAWK CODE AND RADAR SVCS. INSTEAD; AKRON APCH REFERRED ME TO CLEVELAND FSS. I CONTACTED CLEVELAND FSS ON 122.2 AND SPENT SEVERAL MINS ATTEMPTING TO EXPLAIN TO THEM MY CURRENT SIT (IN AND OUT OF IMC) AND THE DETAILS OF MY PROPOSED FLT PLAN. CLEVELAND FSS REPEATED MY PROPOSED FLT PLAN WRONG; HAD DIFFICULTY CAPTURING MY NAME; INSISTED ON A CALCULATED TIME ENRTE TO AGC AND APPEARED TO THINK I WAS ON THE GND AT PHD; WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE AIR AND IN VARYING CONDITIONS -- NONE OF THEM ESPECIALLY FAVORABLE. EVENTUALLY; CLEVELAND FSS RETURNED ME TO AKRON APCH. UPON RETURNING TO AKRON APCH; I WAS ADVISED THEY DIDN'T HAVE MY FLT PLAN IN THE COMPUTER YET; AND INSTRUCTED ME TO TURN TO A HDG OF 360 DEGS TO AVOID PITTSBURGH CLASS B AIRSPACE. THIS TOOK ME BACK TOWARDS; OR PARALLEL TO THE WX I WAS TRYING TO BEAT. MY RECENT HDG HAD BEEN 120 DEGS; TAKING ME BACK TO THE HLG VOR WHERE I HAD JUST COME FROM AND WHERE CONDITIONS WERE GOOD. AT AN ALT OF 3000 FT MSL; I WOULD HAVE BEEN BELOW PITTSBURGH CLASS B. AFTER SEVERAL MINS; AKRON APCH ADVISED THEY WEREN'T RECEIVING MY XPONDER AND WITHOUT SUCH; THEY WOULD BE UNABLE TO ASSIST ME. I WAS ADVISED TO MAINTAIN VFR -- APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND I WAS ALREADY IN AND OUT OF IMC THAT WAS WORSENING ON THEIR ASSIGNED HDG OF 360 DEGS. AFTER SEVERAL MORE MOMENTS OF CYCLING THE XPONDER; CHKING CIRCUIT BREAKERS AND RECYCLING THE NUMBERS; AKRON APCH RECEIVED MY SIGNAL AND INSTRUCTED ME TO CLB TO 5000 FT AND HEAD DIRECT HLG. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; AKRON APCH HANDED ME OFF TO PITTSBURGH APCH ON A FREQ I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH. UPON CONTACTING PIT APCH; THEY IMMEDIATELY ADVISED ME I WAS ON THE WRONG FREQ AND TO SWITCH TO THE MORE APPROPRIATE FREQ FOR MY ALT; ACFT AND FLT PLAN. PIT APCH GAVE ME A DSCNT TO AN ALT BELOW THE CLOUDS AND I FINISHED MY IFR FLT IN VMC MAKING A VISUAL APCH TO AGC. DISAPPOINTMENTS: VFR INTO IMC IS UNACCEPTABLE. I UNDERSTAND THAT AND WAS SURPRISED HOW QUICKLY THE CONDITIONS CHANGED IN THE LAST FEW MOMENTS. HAD I NOT HAD AN INST RATING; I MIGHT HAVE MORE CRITICALLY EVALUATED THE SLOWLY CHANGING CONDITIONS EARLIER AND ABORTED THE FLT; BUT VISIBILITY TO THE GND WAS ACCEPTABLE AND MY FIRST CONTACT WITH ACFT AT PHD APPEARED FAVORABLE. ONCE IN TROUBLE; I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE RESPONSE OF AKRON APCH; AND THE DIFFICULTY I EXPERIENCED WITH CLEVELAND FSS IN FILING A FLT PLAN. I CONTINUALLY RE-EVALUATE MY COM. WAS IT MY FAILURE TO DESCRIBE MY SIT? I DON'T THINK SO. SHORT OF DECLARING AN EMER; I COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY ABANDONED ME TO FSS WITHOUT RADAR OR RADIO CONTACT. THE CONTINUAL QUESTIONING FROM FSS ABOUT MY PROPOSED RTE; HOW TO SPELL MY NAME; AND WHAT VOID TIME I WANTED WAS FRUSTRATING AT A TIME I WAS IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF RADAR SVCS AND DIRECTIONAL GUIDANCE. AND; UPON RETURN TO AKRON APCH; BEING TOLD TO MAINTAIN VFR (WHICH IS HARD TO DO WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY IN IMC) WAS NOT OF ANY HELP IN MY CURRENT SIT. I WISH I COULD REVIEW THE TAPED XMISSIONS WITH THE ATC CTLRS IN AN ATTEMPT TO ASSIST ME (AND THEM) IN UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE CONFUSION OCCURRED AND HOW TO IMPROVE OUR COMS IN THE FUTURE. PERHAPS MY RADIO XMISSION SIGNAL WAS POOR? PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE ASSERTIVE AND REFUSED TO SWITCH TO CLEVELAND FSS AND SIMPLY DEMANDED AN IMMEDIATE SQUAWK CODE AND RADAR SVCS. IT SEEMS THAT IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN AGAIN TO ME OR ANYONE ELSE; THE PROCESS OF GETTING RADAR SVCS AND AN APPROVED FLT PLAN SHOULD BE EXPEDITED. MY FIRST EXPERIENCE IN ACTUAL SINGLE PLT IFR WAS TOLERABLE; BUT I CAN MORE CLRLY THAN EVER SEE HOW A VFR PLT WITHOUT INST TRAINING COULD EASILY AUGER IN FROM THE COMBINED CONFUSION OF THE ACFT ENVIRONMENT AND THE ADDED PRESSURE FROM THE CLUMSINESS OF THE ATC/FSS ENVIRONMENT IN THIS SIT.",,,,"A PLT IN C152 VFR NEAR PHD INADVERTENTLY ENCOUNTERS IMC AND HAS DIFFICULTY OBTAINING ASSISTANCE FROM ATC.",

WE STATED THAT WE REALIZED THE PROB NOW; APOLOGIZED FOR THE CONFUSION; AND SAID WE WANTED VECTORS FOR THE ILS RWY 10 APCH. ALL WENT WELL AND WE LANDED UNEVENTFULLY.

I FEEL THAT I WAS PROFESSIONAL AND POLITE IN MY XMISSIONS WITH THE CTLRS. 4) THIS TYPE OF EVENT WILL PROBABLY BE FAIRLY COMMON WITH THE CURRENT FUEL LOADS WE ARE GIVEN.

ONCE STARTED; THE ACFT'S ELECTRICAL SYS APPEARED TO BE FUNCTIONING NORMALLY. WHILE TAXIING FOR DEP; THE RADIO INTERMITTENTLY XMITTED TO GND CTL; BUT OPERATED FOR TWR COMS. WHILE EXECUTING THE DEP CLB; WE EXPERIENCED ELECTRICAL SYS FAILURE. THE FAILURE OCCURRED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TWR HDOF TO DEP CTL DURING THE INITIAL CLBING L TURN TOWARD THE VOR. RADIO FREQ LIGHTS WERE BLANK/OUT; INDICATING NO PWR FROM THE ALTERNATOR OR BATTERY. NO CIRCUIT BREAKERS WERE OBSERVED TO HAVE EXTENDED. RADIO CONTACT WITH HANDHELD TRANSCEIVERS WAS ATTEMPTED WITHOUT SUCCESS. THE FPR WAS THEN FLOWN. THE XPONDER WAS LEFT ON 'ALT' AT FIRST IN THE EVENT IT WAS ABLE TO XMIT THE LOST COM 7600 CODE. APPROX 10 MINS INTO THE FLT; THE ACFT'S BATTERY/ALTERNATOR SWITCHES WERE TURNED OFF TO PRESERVE WHATEVER PWR MAY HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE FOR LNDG OPS. GPS RECEIVER'S INTERNAL BATTERIES (NOT SHIP'S PWR) WERE USED TO NAV. WX WAS NIGHT VMC WITH GOOD VISIBILITY. WHILE APCHING ZZZ2; THE BATTERY/MASTER SWITCH WAS AGAIN TURNED ON; WHICH ILLUMINATED THE EXTERNAL NAV LIGHTS MOMENTARILY. THE COMRDO FREQ DISPLAY AND EXTERNAL POS LIGHTS MOMENTARILY LIT AND A RADIO CALL WAS MADE TO ZZZ2 TWR WITH NO RESPONSE. THE RADIO DISPLAY AND LIGHTS AGAIN FAILED AT THIS POINT. AFTER THE LAST RTE FIX ON THE FLT PLAN; WE PROCEEDED TO FLY TOWARD ZZZ2 PARALLELING THE RWY 24 ILS ON THE R SIDE USING THE GPS RECEIVERS. LNDG WAS MADE VIA SHORT STRAIGHT-IN FINAL APCH ONTO RWY 24.

I CHOSE TO TREAT NIGHT VMC AS IF IT WERE IMC LOST COMS AND FLEW THE FPR; BELIEVING THE RTE WAS PROTECTED AIRSPACE FOR THE PROPOSED TIME OF THE FLT WITH THE ACFT'S RADAR TRACK BEING FOLLOWED.

I CONSIDERED LNDG AT MONMOUTH EXECUTIVE; ROBBINSVILLE; AND PRINCETON; BUT EACH HAD PLT CTLED LIGHTING WHICH WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ACTIVATE. I CHOSE ZZZ2 AS THE MOST SAFE ARPT BECAUSE IT IS MOST FAMILIAR TO ME AND I BELIEVED THE RTE WAS PROTECTED AIRSPACE WHERE WE WERE EXPECTED TO BE PER OUR IFR FLT PLAN AND PROPOSED TIME ENRTE. APCHING ZZZ2; WE ATTEMPTED TO LISTEN TO ATIS ON HANDHELD TRANSCEIVERS WITH NO SUCCESS. SINCE THE AIRPLANE HAD NO LIGHTS OR RADIOS; I CHOSE NOT TO CIRCLE THE ARPT/TWR BELIEVING IT FUTILE TO BE SEEN BY ENG SOUND ALONE FOR THE TWR TO SEND A LIGHT GUN SIGNAL. I BELIEVED CIRCLING AN OFTEN BUSY ARPT WITH NO LIGHTS OR RADIO WOULD BE AN UNSAFE CHOICE. I CHOSE TO LAND ON RWY 24.

BOTH THE CAPT AND THE FO DONNED OXYGEN AND SMOKE GOGGLES AND WE INITIATED EMER PROCS FOR ELECTRICAL FIRE/SMOKE. WE CALLED AN EMER CALL WITH ZZZ AND REQUESTED AN IMMEDIATE DIVERSION TO THE CLOSEST ARPT. THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE COMING FROM THE PANEL WAS SIGNIFICANT AND STEADY BUT WE COULD NOT ESTABLISH A SOURCE OR AN AREA WHERE HEAT WAS BUILDING UP. THE FO WAS THE FLYING PLT AND THE CAPT HANDLED THE CHKLIST AND RADIO COMS. THE CHKLIST WAS FOLLOWED AND WE LOST COMS AND NAVIGATION CAPABILITIES DUE TO THE LOSS OF POWER TO THOSE SYSTEMS. THIS ALLOWED US TO ISOLATE THE PROB TO THE PS1 BUS BECAUSE THE SMOKE STOPPED. I THEN REPOWERED THE ACFT AND RE-ESTABLISHED COM WITH ZZZ. WE RECEIVED A CLRNC TO DIVERT TO ZZZZ; FO; AND A 7700 SQUAWK. ONCE ESTABLISHED TOWARDS ZZZZ; I BEGAN TO LOAD-SHED THE ACFT. THE L SIDE ALTERNATOR; GENERATOR; WINDSHIELD HEAT; PITOT HEAT; EFIS; AND LIGHTING WERE TURNED OFF AS WELL AS THE HF WHEN CONTACT WITH ZZZ WAS ESTABLISHED. TWO CIRCUIT BREAKERS WERE TRIPPED ON THE ELECTRICAL PANEL; THE CABIN LIGHTS AND EFIS SYB GEN 3. THE FLT TIME TO ZZZZ; FO; WAS ABOUT 40 MINS. ONCE IN THE DSCNT THE CABIN DUMP VALVE WAS OPENED TO ALLOW CLRNC OF THE SMOKE IN THE CABIN. THE SMOKE DID NOT OBSCURE VISION; BUT DID CAUSE A NOTICEABLE HAZE. HF#2 FAILED AND THAT MADE IT NECESSARY TO HAVE POWER ON HF#1 LONGER THAN WANTED. A FAILURE OF THE EMER MASK INTERCOM MADE IT NECESSARY FOR ME TO HAVE MY MASK OFF TO COM EFFECTIVELY WITH THE FO. APPROX 12 MINS FROM ZZZZ; FO; THE BUS TIE WAS OPENED AND ALL POWER TO PS1 WAS CLOSED. THE SMOKE STOPPED AT THIS POINT. HEAT WAS BEGINNING TO BUILD UP NOTICEABLY ON THE L GLARESHIELD PANEL BEFORE THE BUS TIE WAS CLOSED. NO FLAMES WERE NOTICED BUT THE SMOKE WAS CONSISTENT. AFTER LNDG WITH MOST OF THE ACFT SYSTEMS UNPOWERED; WE SHUT THE ACFT DOWN WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. THE CAPT WAS TREATED AND RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL FOR SMOKE INHALATION. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE FO WAS FLYING AND THE CAPT WAS GOING THROUGH THE CHKLIST AND ISOLATED THE PS1 BUS CAUSING THE SMOKE TO STOP. THE LOADS WERE SHED ON THE PS1 BUS AND TWO CIRCUIT BREAKERS WERE FOUND TRIPPED; ONE BEING CABIN LIGHTING. REACHING 2000 FT THE OUTFLOW VALVE WAS OPENED TO CLR OUT THE SMOKE. THE CAPT WAS TREATED FOR SMOKE INHALATION DUE TO FAILURE OF THE EMER MASK INTERCOM AS IT WAS REMOVED TO COM WITH THE FO. MAINT FOUND THE COCKPIT LIGHTING RHEOSTAT DIMMER WAS OVERHEATED DUE TO A SCREW CUTTING THE OUTPUT WIRING INSULATION AND SHORTING OUT THE RHEOSTAT.

WEATHER AT ALL RPTING POINTS ALONG THE RTE WAS ABOVE COMPANY DAY; CROSS-COUNTRY MINIMUMS. IN FACT; THE LOWEST CONDITIONS RPTED WERE CEILINGS OF 2600 FT OVERCAST AND 5 MI VISIBILITY IN LIGHT RAIN AT ZZZ2. THE FLT WAS RELATIVELY UNEVENTFUL FROM INITIAL LAUNCH FROM BASE THROUGH PICKUP AT ZZZ AND MOST OF THE FLT WITH THE PATIENT ABOARD. THE PLT OF ANOTHER COMPANY ACFT WHO HAD HEARD OUR LAST VOICE RPT TO OUR COMPANY DISPATCHER; CONTACTED US ON THE COMPANY FREQUENCY AND INFORMED US THAT THE FARTHER N WE GOT THE BETTER THE WX CONDITIONS WOULD BE. ABOUT 2/3 OF THE WAY THROUGH OUR LEG FROM ZZZ TO ZZZ2 WE ENCOUNTERED CEILINGS LOWER THAN RPTED AND WISPY MIST AT 500 FT AGL AND BELOW. THE MIST INTENSIFIED TO THE POINT WHERE I WAS BECOMING CONCERNED; SO WE TURNED SW; PLANNING TO LAND BACK AT ZZZ AND CONTINUE THE PATIENT TRANSPORT BY GND FROM THERE. AS WE PROGRESSED TOWARD ZZZ2; CONDITIONS GRADUALLY IMPROVED THE FURTHER W WE GOT. THE IMPROVED CONDITIONS WE FOUND NEAR ZZZ2 LASTED ONLY ABOUT 7 TO 8 MI AND AGAIN BEGAN TO DETERIORATE SIMILAR TO THE WISPY MIST WE HAD ENCOUNTERED EARLIER TO THE E; HOWEVER; AT 500 FT AGL; WE COULD STILL SEE SEVERAL MI UP THE INTERSTATE. GIVEN THOSE CONDITIONS; I BELIEVED CEILINGS AND VISIBILITY WOULD BE IMPROVING VERY SOON; HOWEVER; I STILL HAD NOT MENTALLY DISCARDED THE IDEA OF TURNING BACK IF CONDITIONS WORSENED. ABOUT THE SAME TIME; I PASSED A TOWER ON MY R AND SAW ANOTHER; PERHAPS A MI AHEAD; AT THE 10 O'CLOCK POS AND CONSULTED MY SECTIONAL CHART IN AN ATTEMPT TO PRECISELY FIX MY POS IN RELATION TO ANY OTHER OBSTACLES I MIGHT NEED TO AVOID IF I DID INDEED CHOOSE TO TURN AROUND. WHILE CONSULTING MY CHART; I HEARD THE RADAR ALTIMETER TONE; I HAD SET THE WARNING FLAG AT 400 FT AGL BECAUSE THE TALLEST TOWER I NOTED NEAR MY INTENDED RTE WAS 361 FT AGL. I GLANCED UP FROM THE CHART; NOTED THE NEEDLE GENTLY OSCILLATING AT THE 400 FT MARK; CONFIRMED MY ALT AND HDG WITH A BRIEF GLANCE OUTSIDE AND APPLIED GENTLE AFT PRESSURE TO THE CYCLIC TO INITIATE A GRADUAL CLB BACK TO 500 FT AGL. I THEN CONTACTED CTR; HE TOLD ME I WAS IN 'RADAR CONTACT;' AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME TO RE-CONTACT APCH. I SWITCHED BACK TO APCH; WHO GAVE ME AN ASSIGNED HDG AND ALT. THE CTLR ASKED IF THE ACFT AND PLT WERE INSTRUMENT RATED. I REPLIED 'THE PLT IS; THE ACFT IS NOT' AND TOLD HIM THAT I WAS TRAPPED BETWEEN LAYERS. HE WENT ON TO TELL ME THE WX CONDITIONS SHOULD BE IMPROVING AS WE PROGRESSED TOWARD ZZZ2. GIVEN THESE FACTORS; I WAS CONVINCED THAT THE SAFER AND BETTER CHOICE WAS TO CONTINUE TOWARD ZZZ2. I WILL ADMIT THAT I ALSO REALIZED THAT CONTINUING TOWARD ZZZ2 WOULD PUT THE PATIENT FAR CLOSER TO -- PERHAPS AT -- HIS DEST; HOWEVER; I CONSIDERED THAT 'ICING ON THE CAKE;' AND IT WAS NEVER A FACTOR IN MY DECISION TO CONTINUE. AS THE CTLR WAS COOPERATING WITH ME AND DID NO SOUND ANNOYED OR FLUSTERED; CONTRARY TO COMPANY POLICY; I CHOSE NOT TO SQUAWK 7700 AND CONTINUED ON INSTRUMENTS TOWARD ZZZ2 INTENDING TO BREAK OFF TO ZZZ1 AFTER I BECAME VMC AGAIN. ABOUT 2 MI S OF THE ABC VORTAC; I REACQUIRED CONTINUOUS VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE GND; NOTIFIED APCH AND REQUESTED VFR DIRECT TO ZZZ1. THE CTLR APPROVED MY REQUEST; WE DELIVERED THE PATIENT; AND DEPARTED TO ZZZ2 FOR FUEL. LOOKING BACK; I DON'T SEE MUCH THAT I COULD DO DIFFERENTLY. WHILE; ADMITTEDLY; MY BASIC AIRWORK COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER; I BELIEVE I MADE PRUDENT DECISIONS AT ALL POINTS ALONG THE TIMELINE; AND WE DELIVERED THE PATIENT SAFELY. DURING THIS FLT; AS I HAVE IN NUMEROUS OTHERS; I WAS DEALING WITH MY FLT ENVIRONMENT IN THE BEST WAY I KNEW HOW. UNFORTUNATELY; DEALING WITH THIS SIT REQUIRED MORE HEADS DOWN TIME WITH THE CHART THAN ON AN AVERAGE FLT; BOTH IN ORDER TO ACCURATELY FIX MY POS IF THINGS 'WENT SOUTH' AND TO DETERMINE FREQUENCIES REQUIRED AT POSSIBLE ALTERNATES. IN THE FUTURE; I WILL APPLY EVEN MORE CONSERVATIVE DECISION-MAKING CRITERIA DURING FLTS IN WX CLOSE TO COMPANY MINIMUMS; AND I WILL WORK TO REDUCE HEADS DOWN TIME INMY FLYING.",,,,"A MEDICAL TRANSPORT HELI BECAME IMC ON A VFR FLT PLAN AND CONTINUED TO HIS DEST.",

IF I DID FORGET THAT I WAS ONLY CLRED INTO POS; I AM VERY SORRY. AS FAR AS HOW THE PROB AROSE; THERE WAS CERTAINLY MORE THAN ONE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. BEING THAT THIS WAS A CHK RIDE; I WAS PROBABLY FOCUSED TOO MUCH ON THE 3 UPCOMING IFR APCHS. I HAD ALSO BEEN AWAY FROM HOME NEARLY A MONTH FOR TRAINING; SO I PROBABLY ALLOWED AN EAGERNESS TO GET THE CHK RIDE OVER WITH TO OVERRIDE MY PATIENCE. MY INEXPERIENCE WITH THE COMPANY PROCS MAY HAVE ALSO BEEN A FACTOR. TO ALL THIS; IF I ADD THE BASIC 'CHK RIDE JITTERS' I WAS FEELING; IT THEN BECOMES MORE CLR AS TO WHY I MAY HAVE TAKEN OFF WITHOUT A CLRNC. AS STATED ABOVE; THIS WAS A COMPANY CHK RIDE; SO I WASN'T ALONE. IN THIS CASE; I BELIEVE MY CHK PLT MAY SIMPLY HAVE BEEN TOO FATIGUED BY THE DAY HE ALREADY HAD TO NOTICE WE WEREN'T CLRED FOR TKOF; AS HE WAS AS SURPRISED TO HEAR FROM THE TWR AS I WAS. THE REASON WHY FATIGUE MAY HAVE BEEN A FACTOR IS THAT WE WERE SCHEDULED TO FLY FIRST THING IN THE MORNING; BUT THE CHK PLT HAD BEEN CALLED TO DO A 3.5 HR CHK RIDE WITH SOMEONE ELSE; SO WE ENDED UP GOING IN THE AFTERNOON. AS FAR AS PREVENTING THIS FROM OCCURRING AGAIN; THE BEST SOLUTION I CAN OFFER IS FOR THE PLT AT THE CTLS TO TAKE HIS/HER TIME; AND TO PRIORITIZE.",,,,"A PA32 PLT ON A CHK RIDE DEPARTED A CTLED ARPT WITHOUT CLRNC.",

THE DISPATCH COORDINATOR THEN WENT AND ASKED THE CHIEF PLT AND CAME BACK AND TOLD ME THAT HE HAD SAID THAT IF THE CREW HAD RETURNED THEN YES WE WOULD HAVE TO TEST THEM; BUT BECAUSE THEY DIVERTED TO ZZZ2 THEY COULD CONTINUE ON. AT THAT TIME THE DISPATCH SUPVR SAID THAT WE WOULD NOT WANT TO HAVE THEM TESTED IN ZZZ2 BECAUSE WE WOULD BE STRANDING PAX IN ZZZ2. I WANTED A SECOND OPINION REGARDING THE TESTING AND I ASKED ANOTHER INFLT MGR AND HE TOLD ME TO CALL ZZZ1 AND HAVE THE ON-DUTY MGR GO AND TALK WITH THE CREW TO SEE IF THEY EXHIBITED ANY INITIAL SIGNS THAT WE NEEDED TO DOCUMENT; BEFORE WE COULD HAVE THEM TESTED. I CALLED AND TOLD THE MGR THAT WE NEEDED THIS DONE; AND SHE CALLED BACK AND STATED THAT SHE DID NOT SEE ANY SIGNS OF INTOXICATION; AND SHE FELT THAT THE CREW WAS FINE TO CONTINUE ON FLYING THIS DAY TO ZZZ2. DUE TO THE UNSAFE NUMBER OF FLTS I WAS WORKING THIS DAY; AND THE UNSAFE PHONE AND RADIO SYS AND THE UNSAFE PHONE POLICIES; I WAS NOT ABLE TO DISPATCH THE FLT TO CONTINUE ON TO ZZZ2.",,,,"A CRJ200 CREW DEPARTED WITH LESS THAN DISPATCH RELEASE FUEL.

THE ACFT HAD AN IFR GPS; A #1 NAV/COM OF A KX155 WITH GS INTERFACED TO A HSI; AND A #2 NAV; A NARCO VOR/LOCALIZER/CDI; AND A CENTURY 2000 AUTOPLT COUPLED TO THE #1 NAV. UPON ARRIVING IN THE VICINITY OF ZZZ AT 5000 FT; THE ATIS INDICATED CONDITIONS BELOW MINIMUMS; RVR 1800 AND 100 FT CEILING. A LOW LAYER OF MORNING GND FOG HAD FORMED IN THE VICINITY. ATC REQUESTED INTENTIONS; WE REPLIED WE WISHED TO HOLD AS CONDITIONS WERE IMPROVING. THEY PROVIDED VECTORS INSTEAD OF A HOLD AND REQUESTED WE CLB TO 6000 FT TO STAY CLR OF OTHER TFC. AFTER ABOUT 15 MINS; ATC BROADCAST THAT CONDITIONS AT ZZZ HAD IMPROVED TO RVR 4000 AND 200 FT CEILING. WE REQUESTED AN APCH IN SEQUENCE. WE WERE VECTORED TO THE FINAL APCH COURSE. AS WE APCHED THE ILS; WE WERE REQUESTED TO DSND TO 5000 FT; THEN 3500 FT IN RAPID SEQUENCE. WE HAD DECIDED TO USE THE AUTOPLT FOR THE APCH AND HAD IT ENGAGED IN HDG MODE WITH A DSCNT. WE VERIFIED THE ILS 33 IDENT AND THAT THE HSI DID NOT HAVE ANY FLAGS VISIBLE. WHILE IN THE DSCNT; WE WERE GIVEN THE FINAL TURN ON VECTOR TO JOIN THE LOCALIZER AND TO MAINTAIN 2400 FT UNTIL ESTABLISHED. I BELIEVE WE WERE APPROX 6 MILES FROM THE OUTER. THE STUDENT INCREASED THE RATE OF DSCNT. AFTER OUR TURN TO THE INTERCEPT HDG; THE APCH MODE OF THE AUTOPLT WAS ENGAGED AND WE VERIFIED THAT IT ANNUNCIATED APCH AND GS COUPLING. THE AUTOPLT MAINTAINED THE RATE OF DSCNT (ESTIMATED 1000 FPM) AND INTERCEPTED THE LOCALIZER COURSE. THE GS INDICATOR ON THE HSI INDICATED WE WERE ON THE GS (NEEDLE CENTERED; NO FLAGS). THE LNDG GEAR WAS LOWERED AND THE AUTOPLT CONTINUED TO DSND AT THE 1000 FPM RATE AND BUSTED THROUGH THE 2400 FT INTERCEPT ALT. I ESTIMATE WE WERE STILL THREE MILES FROM THE OUTER MARKER. I REALIZED SOMETHING WAS WRONG AS THE GS CONTINUED TO INDICATE WE WERE ON GLIDE PATH; BUT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A FLY UP INDICATION AT THIS POINT. I DISENGAGED THE AUTOPLT AND APPLIED FULL POWER; BUT BY THIS POINT WE HAD DSNDED TO 1900 FT. AT ALMOST THE SAME TIME; ATC TRANSMITTED A LOW ALT ALERT TO US AND TOLD US TO CLB TO 2400 FT. I REQUESTED THE PLT TO PITCH UP AND INITIATE A CLB. BECAUSE THE GEAR WAS STILL DOWN AND THE PITCH INSUFFICIENTLY HIGH; THE CLB RATE WAS TOO LOW. ATC ASKED IF WE WERE CLBING. I TOOK THE CTLS; PITCHED UP AND RAISED THE GEAR AND CLBED TO 2400 FT. I ADVISED ATC WE WERE MISSING THE APCH AND WE HAD AN EQUIP FAILURE IN THE ILS. ALL DURING THE MISS; THE GS FLAG DID NOT APPEAR AND THE GS NEEDLE INDICATED WE WERE ON GS. AFTER EVALUATING OUR OPTIONS; WE DECIDED TO RETURN TO OUR HOME BASE; WHICH WAS VFR CONDITIONS. WE VERIFIED THE SAME ILS INDICATIONS AT OUR HOME BASE AND WE CONDUCTED A LOCALIZER ONLY APCH. THIS TIME THE INTERCEPT WAS NOT FROM ABOVE WITH A HIGH DSCNT RATE AND WE LEVELED AT THE INTERCEPT ALT BEFORE ENGAGING THE AUTOPLT. ONCE AGAIN; THE GS INDICATIONS WERE NO FLAGS AND GS INDICATING ON GLIDE PATH. WHEN WE ENGAGED THE APCH FUNCTION OF THE AUTOPLT; IT JUST MAINTAINED ALT; AS THAT WAS WHAT THE GS INDICATIONS WERE INDICATING. WE DISENGAGED THE AUTOPLT AND LANDED NORMALLY. AFTER ON THE GND; WE DISCUSSED WITH THE AVIONICS SHOP AND CONCLUDED THE KX155 NAV #1 WAS AT FAULT AS BOTH THE HSI AND AUTOPLT'S ACTIONS CONCURRED WITH ONE ANOTHER. THE KX155 WAS REMOVED AND RESEATED. IT THEN BEGAN TO GIVE GS INDICATIONS OTHER THAN ON GLIDE PATH. WE FLEW ONCE AGAIN TO VERIFY THAT ALL THE SYSTEMS WERE OPERATING CORRECTLY AND THERE WERE NO PROBS INDICATED. LESSONS LEARNED. A RAPID DSCNT THAT HAD US JOIN THE FINAL APCH COURSE FROM ABOVE CONTRIBUTED TO MY INITIAL CONFUSION. THE GS FAILURE WAS DIFFICULT TO DETECT AS WE HAD VERIFIED THE ILS IDENT; VERIFIED THE GS INDICATION WITHOUT A FLAG; ENGAGED THE AUTOPLT; AND GOT CORRECT ANNUNCIATION FOR THE AUTOPLT TRACKING THE ILS. SITUATIONAL AWARENESS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER AND I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED SOONER THAT THE GS INDICATIONS WERE WRONG; AS I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED A FLY UP. THE HIGH DSCNT RATE WITH THE AUTOPLT COUPLED SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHERINDICATOR. I SHOULD HAVE INITIATED THE GO AROUND AND MISSED APCH SOONER. FORTUNATELY; THE CONDITIONS WERE STILL VFR ON TOP OF THE OVERCAST; AND ATC DID A GOOD JOB OF WARNING US. IF NOT; WE COULD EASILY HAVE FLOWN INTO THE GND. I ALSO OBSERVE THAT THERE IS NOT A GOOD WAY OF VERIFYING THAT THE GS FUNCTION IS WORKING NOR IS THERE AN EQUIVALENT REQUIREMENT TO HAVE IT FREQUENTLY CHKED AS THERE IS FOR A VOR RECEIVER. IF WE HAD A SECOND ILS RECEIVER ON BOARD; THAT MIGHT HAVE INDICATED A DISCREPANCY SOONER. FROM THIS POINT ON; I WILL AT LEAST VERIFY GS OPERATION WHILE ON THE GND AT AN ARPT THAT HAS AN ILS INSTALLED; AT LEAST TO THE EXTENT THAT THE GS NEEDLE WILL MOVE FROM THE CTR POSITION (USUALLY A FLY UP) AS PART OF OUR TAXI/RUNUP. I THINK CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE FAA HAVING A REQUIREMENT THAT AN ILS OPERATION BE OPERATIONALLY CHKED ON SOME PERIODIC BASIS; AND LOGGED SIMILAR TO VOR CHECKS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATED THAT THEY WERE IN A DSCNT ON THE AUTOPLT AND CONTINUED TO DSND BECAUSE OF THE CENTERED GS NEEDLE AND NO 'OFF FLAGS'. RPTR SAID THEY COULD HAVE CONTINUED TO FLY INTO THE GND IF THEY WERE NOT WARNED BY THE CTLR. RPTR STATED THAT THE KX155 NAV/COM UNIT HAS A PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD WITH ETCHED GOLD CONNECTORS. RPTR ADVISED THAT THE AVIONICS TECH WHO RESEATED THE UNIT SAID THAT THERE ARE TWO PINS WHICH CTL THE GS UP/DOWN INDICATION AND THAT THESE PINS WERE APPARENTLY NOT SEATED CORRECTLY DURING THE FLT IN QUESTION. RPTR ADVISED THAT THERE IS NO SELF TEST FUNCTION ON THE KX155 THAT WOULD ALLOW THE PLT TO CHK THAT THE OFF FLAG IS FUNCTIONING.",,,,"BE33 FOLLOWS ON GLIDE PATH INDICATION 500 FT BELOW GS INTERCEPT ALT WITH NO INSTRUMENT OFF FLAGS VISIBLE ON A COUPLED AUTOPLT APCH.",

WE WERE GOING TO GET SOME LUNCH AND THEN HEAD ON; BUT I CHKED THE RADAR AND NOTICED THAT THERE WERE POPCORN TSTMS ON THE E SIDE ALONG MY RTE. I WAS WORRIED THAT THE WX WOULD CONTINUE TO GET WORSE AND SO I DECIDED WE SHOULD JUST REFUEL AND LEAVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THAT WAS MY FIRST MISTAKE AND MAJOR MISTAKE. I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN A HURRY. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY SPECIFIC TIME TO MAKE ORLANDO; BUT I HAVE CANCELED SO MANY PREVIOUS FLTS DUE TO TSTMS THAT I DID NOT WANT TO HAVE TO DO THAT LATER IN THE DAY IF THE STORMS GOT WORSE AND EVEN THOUGH IT IS WINTER; I KNOW THAT FLORIDA IS FAMOUS FOR ITS TSTMS. THERE WAS ALSO A LARGE WX SYS/COLD FRONT TO THE W THAT WAS NOT FORECAST TO COME TILL LATER; BUT IT LOOKED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. I MADE A RADIO CALL OVER UNICOM AND TAXIED FOR RWY 22. THE CLOUDS WERE LOW SCATTERED SCUD BUT THE VISIBILITY WAS GOOD. WHEN I HAD LANDED 30 MINS EARLIER; IT WAS SCATTERED SCUD BUT I COULD SEE THROUGH IT. I DID MY RUN-UP AND TRIED TO GET A CLRNC ON THE GND WITH MY CELL PHONE BUT COULD NOT GET THROUGH. I THEN SWITCHED FREQ TO JAX APCH TO SEE IF I COULD GET THEM ON THE GND. I COULD NOT GET THROUGH TO CLRNC DELIVERY AND STARTED TO GET IMPATIENT. A GULFSTREAM MADE A CALL 8 MI OUT AND THEN LANDED ON RWY 22. I LOOKED AT THE CLOUDS AND COULD SEE THROUGH THE SCATTERED LAYER TO CLR ABOVE. I THOUGHT THAT I COULD GET THROUGH A HOLE AND KEEP VFR AND PICK UP MY CLRNC IN THE AIR. THE GUY THAT HAD LANDED IN FRONT OF ME WHEN I HAD LANDED CANCELED HIS IFR FLT PLAN IN THE AIR AND LANDED VFR; SO I CONVINCED MYSELF I COULD DO THE SAME THING TO GET OUT. I MADE A RADIO CALL ON 123.05 CTAF THAT I WAS DEPARTING FROM RWY 22; THEN I BACK-TAXIED TO USE ALL AVAILABLE RWY AND THEN MADE A CALL THAT I WAS DEPARTING RWY 22 AGAIN. I HAD NOT HEARD ANY CALLS AFTER THE GULFSTREAM HAD LANDED. AS I TOOK OFF; EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE; BUT AROUND 300 FT I GOT A TFC ALERT. THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE AROUND ARPTS SINCE PLTS DO NOT TURN OFF THEIR XPONDERS AFTER LNDG; SO I HAD GOTTEN USED TO THE TA'S ON LNDG AND TKOF AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS JUST THE GULFSTREAM THAT HAD THEIR XPONDER ON SINCE THEY WERE STILL ON THE TXWY. I DID NOT LOOK AT THE TFC ALERT SCREEN BECAUSE THIS TCASII SYS SHOWS THE SAME ACFT IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS SOMETIMES WITH A DISCREPANCY OF 1 MI OR SO AND I WOULD HAVE JUST ASSUMED IT WAS THE GULFSTREAM ON THE TXWY. AROUND 400 FT; I ENTERED A CLOUD FOR A VERY SHORT SECOND. AS I EMERGED; I SAW A MERLIN ON APCH FOR RWY 4. I IMMEDIATELY ALTERED COURSE TO THE R ABOUT 1 MI FROM THE MERLIN WHO WAS ABOUT 500 FT ABOVE US. I THEN CALLED ATC AND OPENED MY IFR FLT PLAN WHILE I WAS IN VFR CONDITIONS. FACTORS THAT LED UP TO THIS HAPPENING WERE MY GET THEREITIS; MY DESIRE TO BEAT THE WX; MY NOT LISTENING TO A TFC ALERT; AND MY THINKING I COULD MAKE IT THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE CLOUDS THAT I COULD SEE THROUGH ON THE GND; BUT ONCE IN THE AIR IT WAS A DIFFERENT STORY.",,,,"A CIRRUS SR22 PLT DEPARTED A CTAF ARPT VFR TO ACQUIRE AN IFR CLRNC BUT ENCOUNTERED IMC AND HAD AN NMAC WITH AN APCHING ACFT.",

WE TOOK OFF FROM MIAMI AND THE CLB WAS NORMAL. WE DID RECEIVE 2 CLB CLRNCS WHERE THE ENTIRE ALT CLRNC WAS OMITTED AND WE HAD TO READ A REROUTE 2 TIMES. WE ALSO REQUIRED A REROUTE TO BE READ 2 TIMES. I THOUGHT THE CTLR WAS PROBABLY AGGRAVATED WITH US. WE WERE CLRED DIRECT LAL; THEN THE CTLR SAID 'FLY A 340 DEG HDG.' WE THEN GOT DIRECT LAL. TFC WAS POINTED OUT. WE THEN GOT 15 DEGS R AND WE LOOKED FOR THE TFC BUT IT WAS IMC. SOMEHOW S OF LAL; WE MADE A TURN TO THE L WHICH CAUSED US TO CONFLICT WITH TFC. WHEN I HEARD THE CTLR SAY ACR X 2 TIMES; I STARTED A TURN R; AS INSTRUCTED; IMMEDIATELY. I WAS CONCERNED THAT I HAD NOT GONE INTO HDG SELECT AND IN FACT MADE THE 15 DEG TURN TO THE R PREVIOUSLY INSTRUCTED. THE AIRBUS IS BAD ABOUT PULLING OR PUSHING A KNOB/SWITCH AND NOT GETTING A RESPONSE; SO I ALWAYS AM CAREFUL TO CHK FMA'S. BUT I WONDERED IF THIS HAD OCCURRED THIS TIME SOMEHOW. WHEN I HEARD 'ACR X' I IMMEDIATELY TURNED R TO A HDG OF 350 DEGS AND WE PASSED SE OF LAL. ATC VERIFIED WE DID TURN 15 DEGS R; SO WE MUST HAVE BEEN IN HDG MODE AS I THOUGHT.

CLRED VIA THE LOUPE ONE SID; LINDEN TRANSITION. THIS SID REQUIRES A R TURN TO 120 DEGS AT 1.8 DME SJC VOR. WE WERE CLRED TO CLB TO 5000 FT AS PER OUR PDC CLRNC AND AS REFLECTED ON THE SID. UPON TURNING OUT TOWARDS THE 120 DEG HDG; I CHKED IN WITH NORCAL DEP RPTING CLBING TO 5000 FT. THE DESIGNATED FO WAS AT THE CTLS IN THE L SEAT. I WAS THE DESIGNATED CAPT SITTING IN THE R SEAT ASSUMING COPLT DUTIES. THE ACFT WAS FLOWN IN THE FMS FLT GUIDANCE MODE WITH THE AUTOPLT ENGAGED SHORTLY AFTER TKOF. THE ACFT HELD COURSE NORMALLY THROUGH THE TURN TO A 120 HDG AFTER THE 1.8 DME FIX. SHORTLY AFTER BEING ESTABLISHED ON THE 120 DEG HDG; THE ACFT; NOT KNOWN TO ME; BEGAN AN INADVERTENT SLOW TURN TOWARDS THE SJC VOR. WE WERE ABRUPTLY TOLD BY NORCAL DEP TO TURN L IMMEDIATELY TO A 120 DEG HDG. THE PLT AT THE CTLS RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY TURNING THE ACFT TO THE L ROLLING OUT ON THE 120 DEG HDG.

LATER THE NEXT DAY THE NORCAL OPS MANAGER STATED TO ME VIA PHONE CONVERSATION THAT OUR POSITION AT THE TIME OF THE OCCURRENCE WAS THE 001 DEG RADIAL AT 5 NM FROM THE SJC VOR. HE ALSO STATED THAT HE WAS REQUIRED TO FILE A DEV RPT. SIGNIFICANT IS THE FACT THAT THE HONEYWELL FMS NAV DATABASE WE WERE USING FOR THIS SID HAS THE ACFT FLYING EXACTLY AS PUBLISHED ON THE SID; ROLLING OUT ON THE 120 DEG HDG; AND THEN SLOWLY DIRECTS THE FLT GUIDANCE SYSTEM TO TURN TOWARDS THE SJC VOR. NOTABLY; THIS SID IF FLOWN USING THE HONEYWELL NAV DATABASE ACTUALLY FLIES THE LOST COM PROC AS PUBLISHED ON THE SID; NOT THE PUBLISHED SID PROC. WE ARE TRAINED TO USE THE AUTOMATION INHERENT TO THE GULFSTREAM V TO ENHANCE SAFETY BY REDUCING COCKPIT WORKLOAD; IMPROVING ACFT FLT GUIDANCE AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE.

WE NEVER HEARD FROM NORCAL DEP ABOUT ANY POTENTIAL CONFLICTING TFC UNTIL WE RECEIVED AN IMMEDIATE L TURN COMMAND. IN FACT WE HEARD VERY LITTLE NORCAL RADIO COMS UNTIL THE OCCURRENCE. WE NEVER RECEIVED A TCAS TARGET THREAT. THIS OCCURRENCE COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED BY: 1) FLYING THE ACFT IN HDG SELECT MODE ONLY; NOT ALLOWING THE FMS/FLT GUIDANCE TO TURN THE ACFT OFF OF DESIRED HDG. 2) REVISING THE HONEYWELL NAV DATABASE TO REFLECT A DISCONTINUITY BETWEEN THE 120 DEG HDG AND THE SJC VOR. 3) SPECIFY ON THE SID 'RADAR DEP.' 4) ELIMINATING THE SID FROM THE NAV DATABASE. 5) STRONGLY RECOMMENDING TO NORCAL DEP CTLRS; AS THEY VERIFY CLBING TFC; TO SAY; 'MAINTAIN HDG 120 DEGS.' CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR ADVISED THAT THEIR CHIEF PLT HAD DISCUSSED THE SIT WITH HONEYWELL AND WAS ADVISED THAT THEY PUBLISHED TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THIS DEP.

I FOUND A PANEL THAT NEEDED TO BE REPAIRED ON WALKAROUND. MAINT REPAIRED PANEL AND THE REST OF THE PREFLT WAS NORMAL. WE PUSHED BACK FROM THE GATE 10 MINUTES LATE. WHILE STARTING THE #2 ENG IT WAS NOTED THAT IT WAS SLOW TO REACH 17% N2. ALL OTHER INDICATIONS WERE NORMAL ON START; TAXI-OUT AND TKOF. AT 80 KTS ON THE TKOF ROLL; ALL ENG INDICATIONS WERE NORMAL. ALL WAS NORMAL WITH LIFTOFF AND GEAR RETRACTION. AT APPROX 500 FT AGL; THE #2 ENG QUIT FOR NO APPARENT REASON. THE CAPT CTLED THE ACFT AND CONTINUED TO FLY THE ACFT WHILE I DECLARED AN EMER AND REQUESTED A RETURN TO THE ARPT. UPON REACHING 1000 FT AGL THE CAPT CALLED FOR 'ALT HOLD 180 KTS.' ONCE WE ACCELERATED; HE CALLED FOR 'LVL CHANGE; 180 KTS.' ATC SWITCHED US TO APCH CTL. THEY GAVE US A TURN; BUT I REQUESTED RWY HDG; AND ATC ASSIGNED 4000 FT. ATC OFFERED US 2000 FT. WE WERE ALREADY AT 2300 FT; SO ATC GAVE US 2500 FT AND A TURN FOR A XWIND LEG. THE ACFT WAS ESTABLISHED ON THE XWIND LEG WHEN I GOT OUT THE ENG FAILURE CHKLIST. STARTING THE ENG FAILURE CHKLIST; THE CAPT ENGAGED THE AUTOPLT; BROUGHT THE APU BUS ONLINE; AND SPOKE WITH THE FLT ATTENDANTS. I THEN MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE PAX REASSURING THEM AND INDICATING A RETURN TO THE ARPT; AND GAVE ATC THE PAX AND FUEL AND NO HAZARD MATERIAL ON BOARD. THE CAPT AND I DISCUSSED A RESTART BUT DECIDED AGAINST IT. WE WONDERED ABOUT FUEL CONTAMINATION AND BECAME CONCERNED WITH #1 ENG. CAPT TOOK THE RADIOS AND I CONTINUED THE ENG FAILURE CHKLIST. ON DOWNWIND WE ENCOUNTERED MODERATE TURB. THE CAPT QUERIED ATC TO SEE IF WE WERE IN SOMEONE'S WAKE TURB. THE CTLR SAID NO. WITH THE TURB AND ONE ENG; THE AUTOPLT WAS NOT DOING A GOOD JOB. AT ONE POINT THE AUTOPLT HAD US IN A STEEPER THAN DESIRED BANK ANGLE SO THE CAPT ELECTED TO HAND FLY. I FINISHED THE ENG FAILURE CHKLIST AND MOVED ON TO THE SINGLE ENG LNDG CHKLIST. I DID CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE ACFT CTL AND MADE CALLOUTS AS THE TURB WAS MODERATE AND THE ACFT WAS BEING TOSSED AROUND QUITE A BIT. WE HAD A FAIRLY QUICK TRIP AROUND THE PATTERN SO I WOUND UP DOING THE DSCNT APCH AND LNDG CHKLIST WITHOUT SEEKING CONFIRMATION FROM THE CAPT. I CONFIRMED GEAR DOWN; FLAP INHIBIT SWITCH; FLAPS 15; AND SPD BRAKE ARMED. THE AUTOBRAKES WERE SET TO MED. WE CONTINUED TO ENCOUNTER MODERATE TURB ON FINAL APCH; HOWEVER; THE CAPT HAD THE ACFT UNDER CTL AND WE WERE CONTINUALLY CORRECTING TO GET THE ACFT ON SPD AND TO KEEP IT ON GLIDE SLOPE AND LOCALIZER. UPON BREAKING OUT OF THE WX; I OBSERVED WE WERE LEFT OF THE RWY AND SLIGHTLY FAST; BUT UNDER CTL AND CORRECTING. AT APPROX 100 FT; I SWITCHED THE AUTOBRAKES TO MAX. WE TOUCHED DOWN SLIGHTLY LONG AND FAST. THE SPEEDBRAKES DEPLOYED AND I MADE THE CALL. THE AUTOBRAKE INOP LIGHT ILLUMINATED AND I CALLED 'AUTOBRAKES DISARMED.' WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE ACFT MIGHT POSSIBLY NOT STOP ON THE RWY; I APPLIED MAX BRAKING ALONG WITH THE CAPT. THE WX AT THE TIME OF LNDG WAS A STRONG XWIND AND MODERATE RAIN. WE CAME TO A STOP WITH OUR NOSE GEAR JUST OFF THE END OF THE RWY. WE CONFIRMED THAT THERE WERE NO INJURIES IN THE BACK OF THE ACFT AND COORDINATED WITH EMER PERSONNEL. THE AFTER-LNDG CHKLIST WAS ACCOMPLISHED. AFTER COORDINATING WITH THE COMPANY AND EMER PERSONNEL; WE COMPLETED THE CHKLIST; PULLED THE APPROPRIATE CB'S; AND WROTE UP THE ENG FAILURE AND OVERWEIGHT LNDG IN THE LOGBOOK.

THE FO REPLIED TO THE CALL AND CTR TOLD US TO LEVEL OFF AT FL280; THAT WE WERE NOT CLRED TO FL250. THIS OCCURRED AT FL283 AND CAUSED NO LOSS OF SEPARATION OR OTHER CONFLICT.

WE HAD RECEIVED A TAXI CLRNC TO RWY 24R AND WHILE ENRTE; HELD AT 2 INTXNS WHILE GND SEQUENCED OTHER TFC. AS WE APCHED RWY 24L; WE WERE GIVEN TKOF CLRNC TO RWY 24R WITH TFC ON A 5 MI FINAL. AS I TOOK THE RWY; I VISUALLY CLRED THE DEP PATH AND ASKED THE FO IF ALL WERE READY FOR TKOF. I THEN ADDED TKOF PWR. THE FIRST CALLS I HEARD WERE 80 KTS; V1; VR; AND ABOUT THAT TIME THE 'X' ON THE FAR END OF THE RWY CAME INTO SIGHT. THERE WERE NO MARKINGS AT TXWY S WHERE WE STARTED FROM. AS I LOOK BACK AND QUESTION MYSELF AND MY FO; MY RESPONSE WOULD BE FOR A BETTER TAXI BRIEFING -- ESPECIALLY IN THE EVENT OF CLOSED TXWYS AND RWYS; AS THEY WOULD PERTAIN TO US; COMMUNICATING AND UNDERSTANDING PRIOR TO TAXI IS A MUST. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 643841: THIS WAS AN FAR PART 91 LEG FROM CLE TO ZZZ WITH NO PAX ON BOARD. THE COPLT IS TYPE RATED IN AND HAS BEEN FLYING THE CHALLENGER FOR SEVERAL YRS.

AS I FINISHED THE CHKLIST; THE COPLT WAS ADVANCING THE THROTTLES FOR TKOF. I WAS SOMEWHAT UNSURE OF WHAT RWY WE WERE ON AND BEGAN LOOKING FOR VISUAL CLUES THAT WERE ON THE CORRECT ONE. I DID NOT COMPREHEND THAT WE WERE ON THE WRONG RWY UNTIL LIFTOFF SPD; WHICH WAS TOO LATE TO ABORT. I STATED AT THAT TIME THAT WE JUST TOOK OFF ON THE WRONG RWY WHICH WAS RWY 24C. TWR CALLED US TO TELL US THE SAME. LOOKING BACK; AS SOON AS I BEGAN FEELING UNCERTAIN OF WHAT RWY WE WERE ON; I SHOULD HAVE CALLED FOR AN ABORT. I COULD HAVE PERFORMED THE LINE-UP CHKLIST SLOWER WITH PAUSES TO LOOK OUTSIDE AND MONITOR THE ACFT MOVEMENT. AN ATC CLRNC FOR US TO TAXI ACROSS RWY 24L AND RWY 24C; CLRED FOR TKOF RWY 24R MAY HAVE PREVENTED THIS INCIDENT. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE COPLT MADE A MISTAKE AND THAT I DID NOT FIGURE THIS OUT IN TIME TO STOP IT.

THESE TWO ROUTES ARE USED BY CBM T-38 AND JAN C-17 ACFT. ALONG OR UNDER THESE ROUTES ARE INSTRUMENT APCHS TO TWO ARPTS. IR68 VS M97/UTA AND IR91 VS PMU. THESE ROUTES ARE SCHEDULED BY CBM AND THE CTLING FACILITY IS ZME ARTCC. ZME MUST GAIN MEM APCH APPROVAL FOR ACFT TO ENTER OR PROCEED WITH THESE IR ROUTES BECAUSE THEY FLY THROUGH OUR AIRSPACE. PROBLEM: WE REALLY ONLY HAVE AN 'EXIT TIME' FOR THE ROUTES. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS; I HAVE WORKED ACFT THAT HAVE FLOWN OVER OR THROUGH THESE ROUTES WHILE CONDUCTING INSTRUMENT APCHES TO THE LISTED ARPT. WE NEVER ARE SURE EXACTLY WHEN THE ACFT WILL TRANSITION OUR AIRSPACE ENCROACHING ON THE UTA ILS/LOC AND GPS APCHES AND MISSED APCH 'PROTECTED' AIRSPACE. THE SAME APPLIES CONCERNING THE RNAV/GPS APCHES INTO PMU. WE ARE EXPERIENCING INCREASED AIR TFC ESPECIALLY AT UTA. THIS TFC WILL ONLY INCREASE OVER TIME. I HAVE BROUGHT THIS MATTER OF CONFLICTING IR ROUTES AND THE IAP TO UTA AND PMU. I HAVE SUGGESTED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO TO COORDINATE WITH ZME AND CBM TO 'REDRAW' THE ROUTES TO DECONFLICT WITH THESE IAP'S. NO ACTION OR SENSE OF A NEED BY MEM SUPPORT STAFF. THEY DO NOT HAVE A CLUE HOW THESE PROCS CONFLICT AND THE FUTURE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY THAT A PREVENTABLE INCIDENT WILL HAPPEN. I HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH IR AND VR ROUTES THAT HAD TO BE 'REDRAWN' AND IT WAS THE ONLY REAL WAY TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION. NOT ONLY WILL A CTLR AND A PLT FIND THEMSELVES IN A 'TIGHT' SIT WITH THESE IAP'S VS IR ROUTES BUT IFR SERVICE WILL BE DENIED TO EITHER THE IR ROUTE ACFT OR THE IFR ACFT NEEDING TO CONDUCT THE IAP AT UTA OR PMU. THE UTA ARPT WILL HAVE MORE SITS FOR CONFLICT. I ANTICIPATE THAT AN IFR ACFT WILL BE PLACED INTO HOLDING WAITING FOR OVER 30 MINS FOR AN IFR IR ACFT TO 'EXIT' THE CONFLICTING IR ROUTE. OR; MEM APCH HAVING TO CONTACT ZME TO HAVE THE IR ROUTE ACFT 'PULLED OFF THE ROUTE.' THIS LOW ALT IR ROUTE AND LACK OF RADIO COMS IS IMPRACTICABLE. I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED AN UNCTLED VFR CONDUCTING THESE APCHES NOT IN CONTACT WITH ATC CONFLICT WITH THE IR ROUTE WHICH IS LOW ALT AND HIGH SPD. SOLUTION: DECONFLICT THE IR ROUTES WITH BOTH UTA AND PMU IAP'S AND MAP'S ASAP. I SEE THESE CONFLICTING PROCS AS AN ACCIDENT TRYING TO HAPPEN. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR INDICATED THAT THE CONFLICTING AIRSPACE/PROCS ARE MIL TRNG RTES; FROM COLUMBUS AFB. NON RADAR PROCS ARE USED ON THESE IR RTES. RELEASES ARE OBTAINED BY THE MIL FROM A NUMBER OF ATC SECTORS; BOTH IN ZME AND MEM TRACON AIRSPACE. MEM TRACON DOES NOT ESTABLISH RADAR ID OR COM WITH THE TRNG ACFT. THE TRACON IS GIVEN AS AN 'IN USE' OR 'HOT' TIME PERIOD DURING WHICH OTHER ACFT AND/OR PROCS MUST BE SEPARATED FROM THIS NON RADAR RTE/PROC. THE RPTR INDICATED THE RTES CONFLICT WITH THE APCH PROCS INTO PMU AND UTA. THE RPTR INDICATED THAT TFC UTILIZING THESE ARPTS IS INCREASING AND THAT DELAYS AND CONFLICTS DEVELOP AS A RESULT OF THE IR RTES. THE RPTR SUGGESTED THAT SOME MEM APCH CTLRS ARE UNAWARE THAT CONFLICTS ARE PRESENT BECAUSE NON RADAR PROCS AND REQUIRED AIRSPACE CLRNC ARE NOT FAMILIAR TO THEM. THE AIRSPACE PROTECTION REQUIRED BY THESE FAST MANEUVERING ACFT IS ALSO OF CONCERN TO THE RPTR AND IS NOT PROTECTED.

WE COMPLETED THE APPROPRIATE PROCS AND CHKLISTS AND THE SMOKE SUBSIDED. IN THE MEAN TIME WE DECLARED AN EMER AND BEGAN RETURNING TO THE ARPT. THE FLT ATTENDANT ADVISED US THAT THERE WAS SMOKE IN THE CABIN; BUT IT WAS SUBSIDING AND THERE WAS NO INDICATION OR VISIBLE EVIDENCE OF SMOKE IN THE LAV OR THE CARGO COMPARTMENT (THERE IS A PEEP HOLE IN THE LAV ENABLING ONE TO SEE INTO THE CARGO BIN). BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS WERE IMPROVING; WE LANDED; BUT DID NOT EVACUATE THE CABIN. WE HAD CRASH/FIRE/RESCUE EXAMINE OUR EXTERIOR FOR ABNORMAL SMOKE/FIRE INDICATION OF WHICH THEY FOUND NONE. WE RETURNED TO THE GATE AND DEPLANED NORMALLY. THIS IS A NOTABLE EVENT TO ME BECAUSE THERE WERE 5 SUCH INCIDENTS IN THE PAST WEEK INVOLVING 2 PARTICULAR REGISTRATION NUMBERS IN OUR FLEET. BOTH ACFT WERE VERY NEW AND HAD SIMILAR FLT TIME LOGGED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE ENGINES. THE PROB WAS APPARENTLY CAUSED BY ENG OIL FROM SOME SORT OF FAULTY LABYRINTH SEAL FINALLY ENDING UP IN OUR BLEED LINE; WHICH IS THE SOURCE OF OUR AIR CONDITIONING. THIS ILLUSTRATES TO ME THE NEED FOR BETTER QUALITY CTL METHODS AT THE ENG ASSEMBLY LINE. (ALLISON ROLLS-ROYCE.) THE ENGINES HAD ROUGHLY 500 HOURS ON THEM WHICH IS BASICALLY BRAND NEW. SMOKE IN THE CABIN CAN BE CATASTROPHIC; AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS A MATTER THAT SHOULD BE OVERLOOKED AS JUST BAD LUCK.

PUSH; TAXI; TKOF WERE NORMAL. I GOT AN UPDATED ATIS SOON AFTER LEVEL OFF SO I COULD REQUEST THE PAPERS FOR THE NEXT LEG. I PROGRAMMED THE ARR INFO INTO THE PERFORMANCE PAGE OF THE BOX AS I WAS WAITING FOR THE PAPERS. I WAS THE CAPT AND PF. CO-PLT AND I GOT INTO A DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECTIVE PAY DATE OF A BID HE WAS AWARDED IN AUGUST WHILE WE WERE WAITING. I ALSO PROGRAMMED THE ALTS FOR THE DSCNT FIXES INTO THE BOX AS I KNEW WE WOULD BE BUSY JUST PRIOR TO TOP OF DSCNT. (I FELT THAT I WAS DOING A GOOD JOB CONFLICTING TASKS AT THAT POINT.) WE LOOKED OVER ALL THE PAPERS ONCE THEY ARRIVED AND WERE DISCUSSING THE FUEL AS WE STARTED DOWN (I THINK IT WAS PLT'S DISCRETION FL240). AT APPROX FL260 WE WERE GIVEN 12000 FT AT SYMON WITH NO SPD RESTR. AS I WAS FINISHING UP THE ACARS RELEASE (APCH BRIEF WAS DONE); WE WERE GIVEN A XING RESTR OF 10 MI N OF FIM VOR AT OR BELOW FL180. I MADE NOTE OF THIS ON MY FLT PLAN AS I BELIEVED IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO PROGRAM SUCH XING RESTRS INTO THE AIRBUS FMGC. I CHKED TO SEE HOW THE DSCNT WAS GOING (I PUT SADDE ON THE PROGRESS PAGE AND FIM WAS THE TKOF POINT ON THE NAV DISPLAY) AND PROCEEDED TO FINISH UP THE ACARS RELEASE. I CALLED FOR THE DSCNT CHK. I WAS APPARENTLY DISTR AND BECAME CONVINCED THAT THE 180 DEG RESTR WAS AT FIM. I CHKED THE DSCNT USING 3-FOR-1 AND MADE SURE THE FL180 ITEMS WERE COMPLETE (LIGHTS; NO SMOKE DING; ETC) THINKING THAT I HAD THE DSCNT NAILED BY ABOUT 3 MI PRIOR TO FIM. THAT WAS WHEN ATC CALLED (IT WAS A FEMALE CTLR; BUT I DIDN'T NOTE THE FREQ) AND ASKED OUR ALT. WE WERE GOING THROUGH FL190 ABOUT 8 MI N OF FIM. THIS WAS WHEN THE CO-PLT AND I SIMULTANEOUSLY REALIZED THAT WE BOTH FORGOT ABOUT THE 10 MI N. WE FESSED UP TO ATC AND THE CTLR REMINDED US THAT IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A DSCNT RESTR; WE SHOULD TELL HER EARLY SO SHE CAN MAKE ALTERNATE PLANS FOR TFC DECONFLICTION. I APOLOGIZED AND ADMITTED THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE 10 MI N AND THOUGHT THE FL180 WAS AT FIM. THIS WAS MOSTLY DUE TO MY MISMGMNT OF THE DSCNT TASK LOAD (ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT I WAS ON TOP OF IT UNTIL ATC CALLED ABOUT OUT ALT). I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY THAT THE AIRBUS FMGC PROGRAMMING LIMITATIONS WERE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR; AS THERE IS NO EASY WAY TO PROGRAM IN RESTRS PRIOR TO PROGRAMMED FIXES. I FEEL THIS WAS A DISTR ISSUE AIDED BY THE FMGC LIMITATIONS OF THE AIRBUS AND THE FACT THAT WE FAILED TO SET THE ALT WINDOW TO THE MOST RESTRICTIVE ALT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SOP. I WOULD; HOWEVER; VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE THE FAA REQUIRE ANY POSSIBLE ALT CONSTRAINTS ISSUED BY ATC BE EASILY PROGRAMMED INTO THE FMGC.",,,,"AN A320 CREW MISSED AN ALT CONSTRAINT BECAUSE THEY WERE DISTR AND ADDITIONALLY HAD DIFFICULTY PROGRAMMING THE FMGC.",

THE FO WENT BACK TO FIRST CLASS TO LOOK AT THE #1 ENG AND SAW A RING OF ICE BUILT UP ON THE ACOUSTICAL TILES INSIDE THE INLET. BY THIS TIME WE WERE ABOUT 100 NM SW OF ZZZ1. WE CALLED ZZZ1 AND ASKED FOR ADVICE FROM MAINT. WE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE ICE BUILDUP WAS CAUSING A BUFFETING ON THE INLET AIR FLOW. AFTER 20 MINS OF TROUBLESHOOTING; THE RECOMMENDATION FROM MAINT WAS TO TAKE THE ACFT TO ZZZ1. THE VIBRATION WAS EVIDENT BUT NOT SEVERE. WE MADE AN OVERWT LNDG IN ZZZ2. UPON INSPECTION OF THE ENG AT THE GATE; WE FOUND THE RING OF ICE WAS MELTING AND 3 LARGE PATCHES OF ICE ON THE INLET BOTTOM FROM 3 INCHES IN DIAMETER TO 6 INCHES IN DIAMETER.

THE RUDDER FELT RATHER STIFF; MORE SO THAN NORMAL. I WAS VERY SLOWLY TAXIING STRAIGHT AHEAD. THERE WAS A TAILWIND OF ABOUT 7 KTS THE DIRECTION I WAS POINTED; AND THERE WAS SOME SLUSHY RESIDUE ON THE TXWY. I MADE A SLIGHT TURN DURING MY TAXI AND TRIED THE RUDDER CHK AGAIN.

I HAVE HAD THIS PARTICULAR ITEM OCCUR MANY TIMES ON THE MD80; AND IT IS ALWAYS WHEN STEERING WITH THE TILLER; HOLDING THE TILLER STEADY WHILE TAXIING; BUT IN A TURN. THE OPERATING MANUAL SAYS TO HOLD THE TILLER STEADY WHILE PERFORMING THE RUDDER CHK. WHEN HOLDING IT STEADY IN A SLIGHT TURN; IT INFLUENCES THE RUDDER CHK AT FULL THROW AS DESCRIBED. I THOUGHT I MUST HAVE BEEN HOLDING THE TILLER OFF FROM CTR. AS I TAXIED STRAIGHT DOWN THE TXWY CTRLINE; I TRIED IT AGAIN AND GOT A NORMAL CHK. I REPEATED THIS TWICE MORE WITH THE SAME RESULTS. I THOUGHT I MUST HAVE HAD THE TILLER IN A TURN WHEN INITIALLY MAKING THE CHK SO I THOUGHT THE FINAL RUDDER CHK RESULTS WERE A CORRECT INDICATION OF NO RUDDER BINDING. INFLT; I WONDERED IF HAVING A BIT OF SLUSH ON THE TXWY MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE PROB. IT MIGHT HAVE INFLUENCED THE TILLER POS DURING TAXI. ON ARR AT ZZZ; I DID ANOTHER RUDDER CHK ON TAXI IN ON A COMPLETELY DRY SURFACE TO SEE IF MY SLUSH IDEA MIGHT BE THE CAUSE. WHAT I FOUND WAS WITH THE TILLER CTRED COMPLETELY (WHITE STRIPE ON THE TILLER ALIGNED WITH THE TILLER SHROUD WHITE STRIPE) THE RUDDER WAS NOW VERY; VERY STIFF TO MOVE. MOVING THE TILLER A SMALL AMOUNT TO THE R MADE IT LESS STIFF; BUT STILL VERY STIFF. MOVING THE TILLER TO THE L FREED UP THE RUDDER TO FEELING NORMAL TO THE L; SLIGHTLY SPONGY TO THE R. I DECIDED THAT THE GOOD CHKS I GOT AT DCA MUST HAVE BEEN WITH THE TILLER SLIGHTLY L OF CTR. I DID NOT NOTICE THE STRIPE POS ON TAXI OUT. I ALSO DECIDED THAT IT APPEARED THE CABLING FOR THE TILLER MUST BE OFF; SO THAT THE CTRED TILLER GAVE A FEEL LIKE A TURNED TILLER NORMALLY DID. I WROTE UP THE TILLER IN THE LOGBOOK ON ARR AT THE GATE IN ZZZ. I STILL AM CERTAIN THAT FULL THROW OF THE RUDDER WAS AVAILABLE.

HE ALSO FOUND OUT THAT CARGO WAS PLACED IN THE FORWARD PIT FROM ORD-ZZZ ON OUR PREVIOUS LEG -- AGAIN; AGAINST SOP. WE DECIDED TO DIVERT TO GET THE CARGO OUT OF THE PIT. THE CARGO WAS REMOVED AND WE AGAIN TOOK ON MORE FUEL. THE FINAL LEG WAS UNEVENTFUL; EXCEPT FOR SOME VERY ANGRY CUSTOMERS.

OUR RNAV DEP PROCS ON THIS CONFIGURATION HAVE RWY 25 DEPS FLY RWY HDG FOR 3 MILES; THEN TURN S TO A FIX CALLED ROPPR; WHICH IS 7 MILES SW OF THE ARPT. RWY 19 DEPS DO THE SAME. NON RVAV ACFT DEPART RWY 25 HDG TO 3 DME; THEN TURN TO A 190 DEG HDG. OFF RWY 19; THEY FLY RWY HDG TO 3 DME AND THEN TURN TO A 210 DEG HDG; ALL CLBING TO 7000 FT. AS YOU CAN TELL; IF TWR IS DEPARTING RWY 25 AND RWY 19; OUR PROCS ARE DESIGNED TO PUT TWO DEPARTURES AT THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAME ALT (CLBING ABOVE 7000 FT CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED UNTIL THE VICINITY OF ROPPR DUE TO ARRIVALS DSNDING TO 8000 FT). THIS PROC CAN WORK IF TWR GIVES THE DEP CTLR ENOUGH ROOM BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE DEPS OFF RWY 19 AND RWY 25; AND THE ACFT ARE LIKE TYPES; AND WIND IS NOT A FACTOR. IT IS A MARGINALLY ACCEPTABLE PROC UNDER THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES. IN THIS INSTANCE; TWR DEPARTED 10 TO 12 IFR JETS; MOST OF THEM OFF RWYS 19L/R; ALL WITHIN A 15 MINUTE WINDOW; ALL MAINTAINING VISUAL SEPARATION FROM THE PLANE AHEAD. THE FIRST IN THE STRING WAS AN MD83. RIGHT BEHIND HIM WAS A FALCON 20; LESS THAN 1.35 MILES IN TRAIL. WHEN I CONFIRMED THAT THE FALCON STILL HAD THE MD83 IN SIGHT; HE SAID YES; BUT IN ORDER NOT TO PASS HIM; HE WAS 'REDUCING TO 1-7-0 KTS.' LESS THAN 2 MILES BEHIND THE FALCON WAS A B737; WHO I IMMEDIATELY TOLD THAT THE FALCON WAS SLOWING. AS I WAS WORKING TO SEPARATE THIS ACFT AS BEST AS I COULD BEFORE AND AFTER ROPPR; TWR LAUNCHED ANOTHER 4 TO 5 DEPS; ALL LESS THAN 2 MILES IN TRAIL; MOST OFF RWY 19R/L; BUT ONE NON RNAV OFF RWY 25. AS I GOT BUSIER TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF SEPARATION; ONE OF THE DEPS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS IMC AT 7000 FT. I TOLD THE SUPVR; WHO TOLD TWR TO STOP VISUAL SEPARATION BETWEEN DEPS. BY THEN I HAD 15 OR SO ACFT ON FREQ; MOST WITHIN 20 FLYING MILES OF THE ARPT. AS I TRIED TO GET CAUGHT UP; I NOTICED THE NON RNAV ACFT; AT 7000 FT; WAS ON AN INTERCEPT WITH ONE OF THE RWY 25 RNAV DEPS; JUST S OF ROPPR JUST AS THE PROC IS DESIGNED TO DO. I HAD TO VECTOR THIS ACFT DUE W BOUND AND THE RNAV ACFT DUE S BOUND TO AVOID AN OE AND POSSIBLE NMAC. (I BELIEVE I DID NOT LOSE IFR SEPARATION; BUT I AM NOT SURE. AFTER ANOTHER 15 MINUTES OR SO OF WORK; I MANAGED TO GET THE SECTOR SORTED OUT.) SEVERAL ISSUES ARE AT FAULT HERE: 1) OUR DEP PROCS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO SEPARATE AIRPLANES. ON THE CONTRARY; THEY ARE DESIGNED TO PUT ACFT AT THE SAME SPOT AT THE SAME ALT. 2) TOO MANY TWR CTLRS HAVE NO CLUE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR DISASTER THEY CREATE WHEN THEY 'NOSEWHEEL' NUMEROUS IFR JETS OFF THE SAME RWY WITH 1.5 TO 2 MILES BETWEEN THEM. SEVERAL THINGS COULD HAVE HELPED THIS SIT: 1) OUR PROCS COULD PUT ACFT ON DIVERGING COURSES SOONER AFTER DEP (SOME OF OUR DEPS DO NOT SEPARATE LATERALLY UNTIL 20 PLUS MILES FROM THE ARPT). 2) TWR SHOULD NOT LAUNCH SUCCESSIVE IFR DEPS (IF OUR DEP PROCS REMAIN UNCHANGED) UNLESS THEY HAVE 3 MILES IN TRAIL OR MORE. 3) AFTER THE 5 TO 6 RWY 19 DEPS; I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED DEPS COMPLETELY. 4) TWR SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE AWARE OF THE WX. WHEN I LEFT WORK A FEW MINUTES AFTER THIS; THERE WAS A SOLID LAYER OF CLOUDS AT 7000 TO 8000 FT. (I JUDGED THE HEIGHTS OF THE CLOUDS USING SURROUNDING MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN CLEARLY VISIBLE TO THE TWR. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS POINT ENOUGH: OUR DEP PROCS WILL RESULT IN AN OE; NMAC; OR MID AIR BEFORE THE END OF 2005.

THE FO'S ALTIMETER WAS READING SLIGHTLY HIGHER (IT NORMALLY READ ABOUT 100 FT HIGHER THAN THE CAPT'S ALTIMETER) THAN NORMAL; BUT THE STANDBY ALTIMETER WAS READING 140 FT HIGHER THAN THE CAPT'S ALTIMETER; WHICH IS WHAT IT NORMALLY READ.

THE 'NORMAL' SPLIT BTWN THE CAPT'S ALTIMETER AND THE STANDBY ALTIMETER HAS NEVER BEEN EXPLAINED AND IT CONTINUES TO THIS DAY.

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE FACTS AS BEST AS I CAN RECALL: ACFT WAS A DASH 8 Q400. DISPATCHED WITH CREW OF 4 FROM SEA-MSO-FCA. FO WAS ME AT 1 YR EXPERIENCE IN PART 121 OPS AND EQUIP. CAPT WAS 4 MONTHS TO RETIREMENT. WX FORECAST FOR MSO AND FCA INCLUDED POOR VISIBILITY AND BLOWING SNOW AT OUR ETA. ACFT WAS ACCEPTED WITH AUTOMATIC PRESSURIZATION INOP PER MEL. (OP MUST BE CONDUCTED IN MANUAL MODE -- VERY HIGH WORKLOAD TO MAINTAIN PROPER DIFFERENTIAL.) I WAS CALLED OUT ON RESERVE AND WAS LATE ON ARR; ALSO THE 4TH FO TO HAVE FLOWN ON THIS 4-DAY TRIP. FURTHER FLT DELAY WAS INCURRED AT SEA AND MSO BECAUSE OF DEICING. THIS IS HOW THE FLT FROM MISSOULA TO KALISPELL UNFOLDED AS BEST AS I CAN REMEMBER: WE DEPARTED LATE FROM MISSOULA TO KALISPELL DUE TO ACFT DEICING WITH TYPE 1 AND TYPE 4 FLUIDS AS IT WAS BEGINNING TO SNOW AND FREEZING FOG WAS IN THE AREA. WE DEPARTED FROM RWY 29 AND COMPLIED WITH THE OBSTACLE CLRNC DEP. CLRED TO KALISPELL VIA VICTOR 231 AT 16000 FT MSL. DUE TO THE POOR WX AT KALISPELL; PIC ELECTED TO BE PF. HE HAD ALREADY BEEN ON DUTY FOR 12 HRS AND WAS VISIBLY FATIGUED AND READY TO GET TO THE HOTEL. ON CLBOUT; PIC ASKED FOR BLOCK ALT WITH DIRECT TO SMITH LAKE NDB TO SHORTCUT THE ARR. THE ENTIRE FLT FROM MSO-FCA WAS BLOCKED AT 21 MINS; AND AS PNF; I WAS ALREADY ENTIRELY OVERLOADED MAKING COMPANY CALLS; GETTING ATIS; PLATES; FREQS; CHKLISTS AND TRYING TO MANUALLY OPERATE THE OUTFLOW VALVE SINCE OUR AUTO-PRESSURIZATION CAPABILITY WAS INOP. THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME HAVING TO OPERATE AN ACFT IN MANUAL MODE. I DON'T BELIEVE I WAS EVER TRAINED TO MANUALLY OPERATE THAT SYS; OTHER THAN DISCUSSIONS IN GND SCHOOL. SHORTLY AFTER WE LEVELED OFF AT 16000 FT MSL; THE CABIN PRESSURIZATION MASTER WARNING WENT OFF; INDICATING THE CABIN PRESSURE HAD EXCEEDED 10000 FT. I WAS STILL IMMERSED IN READING THE DSCNT AND APCH CHKLISTS AS THE CAPT WAS TRYING TO SHORTCUT THE ARR AND START DOWN EARLY WITH THE PERMISSION OF ATC. BOTH THE PF/PNF BECAME ABSORBED IN TRYING TO EXTINGUISH THE MASTER WARNING. WE WERE GIVEN A DSCNT TO THE MVA WITH A HDG TO JOIN THE FCA LOC; APCH STILL HAD NOT BEEN BRIEFED. WX WAS RPTED AS 1500 FT OVCST AND 1 NM VISIBILITY WITH SNOW. PNF ABSORBED IN TRYING TO MAINTAIN PROPER DIFFERENTIAL AND DIDN'T NOTICE THAT THE PF WAS OVER 200 KTS; 10000 FT MSL AND ONLY 10 NM FROM THE THRESHOLD OF RWY 2 AT FCA. WE WERE ON THE LOC; GS WAS OFF THE SCALE BELOW US AROUND 5 MI OUT; LNDG CHKLIST STILL NOT COMPLETED EVEN THOUGH THE PF HAD PUT THE GEAR DOWN WHILE THE PNF WAS STILL ABSORBED IN TRYING TO MANAGE THE PRESSURIZATION. AS SOON AS THE PF ASKED ME WHAT THE DECISION ALT WAS ON FINAL; I REALIZED HOW HIGH AND FAST WE WERE. I ASKED IF HE WANTED ME TO CALL A MISSED APCH AND GET BACK UP WITH ZLC. HE DID NOT REPLY; AND SECONDS LATER WE BROKE OUT HIGH OVER THE TOUCHDOWN ZONE AT VREF +10 KTS. WE USED THE ENTIRE RWY TO COME TO A STOP. THESE ARE THE FACTORS IN CONSIDER MOST IMPORTANT IN PREVENTING FUTURE INCIDENTS LIKE THIS ONE: 1) FLT SCHEDULE: BLOCK TIMES ARE PREDICATED ON VFR DAYS; NOT ALLOWING FOR TIME TO DEICE AND OTHER WX-RELATED DELAYS -- CONSEQUENTLY PUTTING A LOT OF TIME PRESSURE ON CREW AS LEG AFTER LEG AFTER LEG IS LATE. PIC ALSO WANTED TO GET DONE WITH THE DAY; WHEN IN REALITY HE SHOULD HAVE REFUSED THE ACFT KNOWING HOW MUCH THAT INOP SYS CONTRIBUTES TO HIGH WORKLOAD IN BAD WX. 2) FATIGUE: AFTER ALREADY WORKING A 12 HR DUTY DAY; PIC WAS TIRED AND JUDGEMENT WAS IMPAIRED. 3) TECHNICAL AS WELL AS CRM INEXPERIENCE: NEW FO; RELATIVELY LOW TIME IN ACFT TYPE; NOT PROPERLY TRAINED ON HOW TO OPERATE THE PRESSURIZATION SYS MANUALLY WHILE MANAGING ALL THE OTHER DUTIES OF THE PNF. ALSO; FO DIDN'T QUESTION PIC'S JUDGEMENT ENOUGH EVEN THOUGH HE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE SIT. THE FO SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALERT ENOUGH TO FORCE THINGS TO SLOW DOWN. 4) POOR COMMON SENSE IN DISPATCH/COMPANY MAINT: THAT ACFT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED FOR A NIGHT FLT INTO IMC WITH BAD WINTER WX AND UNCTLED AIRSPACE WITH THE INCREASED WORKLOAD OFTHE PRESSURIZATION SYS BEING INOP.

BOARDING BEGAN AS THE PIC ARRIVED ON THE FLT DECK. THE FLT WAS BOOKED FULL WITH 70 PAX AND A FLT DECK JUMPSEATER. I REVIEWED THE WX AND MAINT WRITE-UPS WITH THE CAPT; TELLING HIM ONLY 9 DAYS EARLIER I HAD FLOWN THIS AIRPLANE WITH THE SAME DISCREPANCY AND WASN'T REALLY COMFORTABLE OPERATING IN BUSY AIRSPACE AT NIGHT WITH THIS SYS INOP. ON TOP OF THAT; WX AT SJC WAS FORECAST TO BE 2 SM; BROKEN OVCST 500 FT WITH TEMPORARY 1/2 SM VISIBILITY AND FOG. PIC ELECTED TO TAKE THE ACFT ANYWAY; PUTTING ME IN A DIFFICULT POS. I WANTED TO WALK OFF THE AIRPLANE AS MY GUT WAS TELLING ME THIS WAS NOT A GOOD SIT TO BE IN. SHORTLY AFTER WE PUSHED BACK; WE GOT A 'FLAP PWR' CAUTION LIGHT AND THE FLAPS WOULD NOT EXTEND WHEN THE LEVER WAS PUSHED. (THIS ALSO HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN UP BY MAINT THIS SAME DAY AS THEY TAXIED IT OVER FROM OUR HANGAR TO THE GATE.) FAULT WAS CLRED; WE TAXIED TO RWY 10R AT PDX. THE PIC WAS THE PF. MAINT PERSONNEL LEFT THE PRESSURIZATION SWITCH IN 'DUMP' MODE; NEITHER ONE OF US NOTICED; AND ON CLBOUT I NOTICED THE CABIN WAS NOT PRESSURIZING. I SWITCHED IT TO MANUAL MODE AND TRIED TO KEEP THE CABIN PRESSURE MASTER WARNING FROM GOING OFF AS WE CLBED THROUGH 10000 FT MSL. SECONDS LATER; THE #2 DC GENERATOR CAUTION LIGHT ILLUMINATED; INDICATIONS ALL SHOWING THE GENERATOR HAD FAILED (ALSO HAVING BEEN WRITTEN UP PREVIOUSLY ON THIS ACFT AND REPLACED). AS PNF; I ACCOMPLISHED THE CHKLIST AND HELPED THE PF PREPARE FOR THE RETURN TO PDX. NORMAL LNDG UNDER DAY VMC OCCURRED AFTER ONLY 21 MINS AIRBORNE. THESE ARE THE FACTORS I CONSIDER MOST IMPORTANT IN PREVENTING FUTURE INCIDENTS LIKE THIS ONE: 1) POOR COMMON SENSE IN DISPATCH/COMPANY MAINT: THAT ACFT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED FOR THE FLT. TOO MANY PREVIOUS WRITE-UPS; OBVIOUSLY RUSHED OUT OF THE HANGAR. HIGH WORKLOAD WITH THE AUTO-PRESSURIZATION SYS BEING INOP ON TOP OF BEING DISPATCHED INTO BUSY AIRSPACE WITH BAD WX AT THE DEST. 2) POOR JUDGEMENT OF PIC/FO: THE PIC NEVER SHOULD HAVE ACCEPTED THIS AIRPLANE IN THE CONDITION IT WAS IN GIVEN ALL THE KNOWN WRITE-UPS. THE FO SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH HIS GUT FEELING; ESPECIALLY SINCE A VERY SIMILAR SIT OCCURRED ONLY 9 DAYS PREVIOUS IN THE SAME ACFT.

WHEN ABOUT 20 MILES NW OF ZZZ I WAS TOLD TO DESCEND DOWN TO 2300 FT; RADAR CONTACT LOST AND CONTACT ZZZ1 CTR ON ANOTHER FREQUENCY. AT THIS POINT I WAS BREAKING OUT OF THE CLOUDS WITH ABOUT 5 MILES VISIBILITY AND I COULD SEE A FAMILIAR HIGHWAY. I CONTACTED THE CTLR WHO ASKED MY LOCATION ACCORDING TO WHATEVER I WAS USING. ACCORDING TO THE GPS I WAS 10 MILES NW OF THE FIELD SO I TOLD HIM THAT. I COULD HEAR THE ZZZ3 FSS TRANSMITTING OVER THE VOR CLRNCS FOR OTHER ACFT TRYING TO DEPART ZZZ. THE ZZZ1 CTLR AGAIN ASKED MY POS AND I TOLD HIM I WAS NEAR THE ARPT AND I WOULD CANCEL IFR. I'VE ASKED MYSELF A THOUSAND TIMES WHY I DID THIS. THE CTLR TOLD ME TO SQUAWK VFR AND CONTACT CTAF-123.0. I TOLD CTAF THAT I WAS APPROX 10 MILES NW INBOUND FOR LNDG. WHEN I DID NOT SEE THE AIRFIELD I KNEW I HAD GOTTEN MYSELF INTO A MESS. I IMMEDIATELY DECIDED TO CLB TO MINIMUM SAFE ALTITUDE OF 2400 FT WHERE I FOUND MYSELF BACK IN IMC. I BEGAN TO USE MY VOR TO FIGURE OUT WHERE I WAS AND I THINK I WAS REALLY CLOSE TO THE VOR CONE OF CONFUSION BECAUSE I COULD NOT FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT RADIAL I WAS ON. THE ACR PLTS ASKED ME ON CTAF IF I NEEDED ANY HELP AND IF I WAS IFR RATED. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW THE DIALOGUE WENT BUT I TOLD THEM TO MAKE SURE NO ONE WOULD TAKE OFF. THEY ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO DECLARE AN EMER AND I SAID YES. I CLBED UP TO GET HIGH ENOUGH FOR CTR TO SEE ME ON RADAR. THE ACR PLTS HAD GIVEN ME A SQUAWK CODE AND A FREQUENCY TO CONTACT CTR WITH. I CONTACTED CTR AND A NICE VOICE VECTORED AND DESCENDED ME TOWARD THE CITY WHICH LINED ME UP WITH RWY 18. ONCE ON THE GND AT ZZZ I THANKED THE ACR CREW WHO PRACTICALLY SAVED MY LIFE. I GOT THE HINT THAT THEY WEREN'T HAPPY WITH ME. WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE THE AMOUNT APPRECIATION I HAVE FOR THOSE THAT HELPED ME. I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IN ALL OF THIS IS THAT I EXCEEDED MY ABILITIES AS A PLT WITH THE EQUIPMENT THAT I HAD. I SHOULD HAVE NEVER CANCELLED MY IFR WITH CTR NOR SHOULD I HAVE RELIED ON 1 VOR AND A HANDHELD GPS. I LEARNED A VALUABLE LESSON THAT DAY THAT I THOUGHT I HAD LEARNED IN COLLEGE. I HAVE STUDIED EVERY PARAMETER OF THIS INCIDENT AND HAVE TALKED TO PLTS THAT FLY IN AND OUT OF ZZZ. I AM LUCKY THAT I DIDN'T HURT MYSELF OR ANYONE ELSE IN THIS INCIDENT. MY BOSS TOLD ME 'WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD OF AVIATION.' I DIDN'T FIND IT FUNNY. I AM THE ONE TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE AND WILL MAKE SURE I DON'T FIND MYSELF IN A SIT LIKE THIS AGAIN. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVELED THE FOLLOWING INFO: PLT STATED THAT NOT ONLY WAS THE VOR UNRELIABLE BUT THE HANDHELD GPS WAS BASICALLY USELESS FOR HIM. IT HAD A 2 INCH X 2 INCH SCREEN; WAS AN OLD MODEL;  AND USED A SIMPLE POINTER DIRECTING THE OPERATOR TO THE NEXT WAYPOINT.

THE FO WAS HANDLING THE ACFT AND I WAS HANDLING ATC COMS. AFTER ACKNOWLEDGING THE CLRNC AND BEGINNING THE DSCNT; THE CTLR ADVISED THAT THERE WERE RPTS OF LASER ACTIVITY COMING FROM N OF THE GRAPEVINE LAKE AREA. AFTER ACKNOWLEDGING THE ADVISORY; AS I TURNED TO THE FO TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT THE ADVISORY; I WAS STRUCK IN THE L EYE BY A MOMENTARY BLINDING WHITE LIGHT OF A PERCEIVED SMALL DIAMETER. ALTHOUGH NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH TO ILLUMINATE THE ENTIRE FLT DECK; IT WAS BRIGHT ENOUGH TO BRIEFLY ILLUMINATE THE L SIDE OF THE AREA. THE LIGHT CAME FROM THE LOWER L QUADRANT OF THE FORWARD WINDSHIELD; THUS INDICATING A POSITION BELOW AND TO THE L OF OUR RTE OF FLT. ALTHOUGH I WAS MOMENTARILY STUNNED BY THE LIGHT; I ESTIMATED WE WERE APPROXIMATELY ABEAM THE END OF THE RWY 36 COMPLEX AT AN ALT OF ABOUT 8000 FT. THE ONE THING THAT I DID NOTE WAS THE TIME ON THE ACARS AS I WAS LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION AND IT WAS XA:49Z. MY REFLEX REACTION WAS TO LOOK BACK TO THE L AND I NOTED A SECOND BRIEF FLASH WHICH FORTUNATELY DID NOT MANAGE TO STRIKE THE FLT DECK AGAIN. I RPTED THIS TO THE APCH CTLR AND GAVE HIM THE DETAILS THAT I HAD. I RPTED THAT IT APPEARED THAT THE SOURCE WAS APPROX ONE MILE N OF THE LAKE AND APPROX TWO MILES W OF OUR TRACK (AFTER LNDG; LOOKING AT THE LOW ALT CHART; I ESTIMATED THIS TO BE ABOUT THE 345 DEG RADIAL AT 10 MILES OFF OF THE MAVERICK VOR). THE CTLR ASKED FOR THE COLOR AND I RESPONDED THAT IT WAS CLEARLY WHITE. WHEN ASKED IF THE BEAM APPEARED TO BE TRACKING OR SEARCHING FOR THE ACFT; I REPLIED THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TELL AS IT APPEARED TO BE RANDOM IN NATURE. INITIALLY; FOR PERHAPS A PERIOD OF 2 TO 3 SECONDS I HAD DIFFICULTY SEEING OUT OF MY L EYE HOWEVER SHORTLY THEREAFTER; MY EYESIGHT RETURNED TO ALMOST NORMAL WITH JUST A SLIGHT BLURRINESS WHICH SLOWLY FADED AWAY. MY R EYE WAS UNAFFECTED. THE FO; WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THE ARPT OFF THE R SIDE OF THE ACFT; DID NOT SEE THE FLASH AND HIS EYESIGHT WAS UNIMPAIRED. THE REMAINDER OF THE APCH WAS FLOWN NORMALLY AND THE LNDG WAS UNEVENTFUL. ON ARR AT THE GATE; I CONTACTED THE TRACON SUPVR TO FOLLOW UP WITH HIM ABOUT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE HAD. I REPEATED THE ABOVE MENTIONED DETAILS AND THAT THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING FURTHER THAT I COULD ADD. AS I FELT SORENESS IN MY L EYE; I CONTACTED THE DUTY CHIEF PLT AND WE AGREED THAT IT WOULD BE BEST FOR ME TO SEEK A MEDICAL EVALUATION. I REMOVED MYSELF FROM FLT STATUS AND PROCEEDED TO MEDICAL CTR TO HAVE MY EYE CHECKED. THE ER DOCTOR DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO BLEEDING OR BURNS WITHIN THE EYE AND THAT THERE APPEARED TO BE NO PERMANENT DAMAGE; ALTHOUGH I WAS REQUESTED TO HAVE MY OWN OPHTHALMOLOGIST VERIFY THIS PRIOR TO RETURNING TO FLT STATUS.

THE PLT RPTED AN ALTIMETER SETTING OF 30.53 AND I TOLD THE PLT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 30.13. AFTER THE PLT PUT IN THE NEW ALTIMETER; I ASKED THE PLT TO VERIFY ALT. AT THIS TIME I HAD ISSUED A CLB TO 3000 FT AND THE MODE C WAS INDICATING AT TIMES MORE THAN 300 FT OFF; SO I HAD THE PLT STOP THE ALT SQUAWK. I VECTORED THE ACFT 3 TIMES FOR THE LOC BACK COURSE RWY 35R AND EACH TIME THE PLT COULD NOT FLY THE APCH. THE ACFT WENT UNSAFELY L OR R OF COURSE REQUIRING ME TO TAKE THE ACFT OFF THE APCH AND STARTING OVER. THE PLT WOULD ONLY SAY THAT HE RECENTLY HAD HIS RADIOS WORKED ON AND WANTED VECTORS. I TOLD THE PLT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT BY WANTING VECTORS BECAUSE THAT WAS IN FACT WHAT I HAD BEEN GIVING THE PLT. I WAS VECTORING THE ACFT EACH TIME FOR THE APCH. PIE DOES NOT HAVE A PUBLISHED ASR APCH AND THE ILS RWY 17L WAS NOT THE BEST CHOICE DUE TO THE STRONG TAILWIND COMPONENT ON FINAL. I DID ASK THE PLT IF HE HAD AN INSTRUCTOR ON BOARD; AND HE SAID HE DID NOT. A SHORT TIME LATER; I FOUND OUT HE HAD 3 HRS 30 MINS OF FUEL ON DEP AND THERE WERE 2 SOULS ON BOARD. I DECIDED AFTER THE FIRST APCH AND THE WAY THE PLT COULD NOT FOLLOW DIRECTIONS THAT I WOULD TREAT THIS SIT AS AN EMER BECAUSE THE TOPS WERE AT 2400 FT AND THE CEILING WAS AROUND 800 FT OVCST REQUIRING THE PLT TO BE IN ACTUAL IFR CONDITIONS FOR MOST OF THE APCH. AFTER THE FAILED ATTEMPTED ON THE LOC BACK COURSE; IT WAS DECIDED (WITH THE PLT'S CONCURRENCE) TO VECTOR THE ACFT FOR THE ILS RWY 17L. MY SUPVR CONCURRED. I VERIFIED THAT THE PLT HAD ALL THE REQUIRED DATA TO EXECUTE THE APCH AND CLBED THE ACFT TO 3000 FT AGAIN AND STARTED THE ACFT NBOUND FOR THE APCH. SHORTLY AFTER THE LAST ATTEMPT FOR THE BACK COURSE; I VECTORED A LEAR FOR THE BACK COURSE AND THIS PLT VERIFIED THE LOC WORKED FINE AND DID NOT HAVE ANY PROB MAKING THE APCH. I WAS OFFERED A BREAK BY ANOTHER CTLR. I ADVISED THE OTHER CTLR THAT IF HE WANTED THE POS WITH THE SIT AS IT WAS WITH THE CESSNA; HE COULD TAKE THE POS. AFTER A THOROUGH BRIEFING; THE RELIEVING CTLR TOOK OVER. THE CESSNA WAS ABLE TO LAND UTILIZING THE ILS RWY 17L. SEVERAL ISSUES CONCERNED ME WITH RESPECT TO THE CESSNA'S TIME IN THE AIR. THE PLT DID NOT SEEM TO GET DIRECTIONS CORRECT AND DID NOT SEEM QUALIFIED FOR THE FLT HE HAD FILED. I BRIEFED MY SUPVR OF THE PROBS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FLT AGAIN AFTER I WAS RELIEVED. I ALSO FOUND OUT FROM CO-WORKERS THAT THIS PLT HAD THESE KINDS OF PROBS IN TIMES PAST DURING SERIOUS IFR WX.

I WAS WORKING A COMBINED RADAR SECTOR WITH LIGHT TFC. I HAD A MIL ACFT SBOUND ON A STANDARD RTE. WHILE THE ACFT WAS ABOUT 15 MI FROM THE RECEIVING SECTOR'S AIRSPACE IN AN AUTOMATED HDOF STATUS; THE RECEIVING CTLR YELLED OVER HE WAS NOT TAKING THE HDOF UNLESS I ASKED THE ACFT HIS DEST. HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT THE FLT PLAN WAS INCOMPLETE. HE ALSO HAD VERY LIGHT TFC. I LOOKED AT THE FLT PLAN AND CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS COMPLETE. ACFT X'S FLT PLAN TERMINATED AT A RADIAL/FIX POINT. THIS WAS AN ENTRY POINT INTO A VR RTE. THIS IS COMMON FOR A MIL FLT PLAN. THE RECEIVING CTLR MUST HAVE BEEN CONFUSED BY THIS. IT IS INTERESTING THAT NO PREVIOUS CTLRS WERE CONCERNED WITH THIS INFO. IN ADDITION; IT WAS VERY CLRLY EXPLAINED IN THE REMARKS SECTION OF THE FLT PLAN EXACTLY WHAT ACFT X WAS GOING TO DO AT THE RADIAL/FIX (CANCEL IFR AND ENTER VR RTE). AFTER CONFIRMING THE FLT PLAN WAS COMPLETE; I EXPLAINED IT TO THE RECEIVING SECTOR. THE RADAR ASSOCIATE AT THE RECEIVING SECTOR AND I HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE INFO. HE AGREED THAT ACFT X'S FLT PLAN WAS OK AND COMPLETE. THE ACFT WAS STILL IN MY AIRSPACE AND IN AUTO HDOF STATUS TO THE RECEIVING CTLR. I ASKED THEM AGAIN TO TAKE THE HDOF. THE RADAR ASSOCIATE PUT HIS HAND UP IN A GESTURE OF FRUSTRATION. HE INDICATED THAT HE COULDN'T TAKE THE HDOF BECAUSE THE RADAR CTLR DID NOT WANT TO. I ASKED SEVERAL TIMES FOR THEM TO PLEASE TAKE THE HDOF. THEY HAD NO CONFLICTS FOR THIS AIRPLANE. I DID NOT WANT TO SPIN (HOLD) AN ACFT FOR NO REASON. THEY NEVER INDICATED FOR ME TO HOLD THE ACFT. I ASSUMED THE RECEIVING CTLR WAS BEING STUBBORN AND JUST GIVING ME A HARD TIME. I HAVE WORKED WITH HIM FOR MANY YRS AND KNOW HIS PERSONALITY. I THOUGHT HE WOULD TAKE THE HDOF. THE SUPVR WAS THEN IN THE AISLE BEHIND US. I ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED ME TO DO. HE JUST REPLIED 'HOLD ON.' ACFT X HAD THEN ENTERED THE RECEIVING CTLR'S AIRSPACE. I WAS GETTING BUSY WITH OTHER AIRPLANES AND ASKED FOR HELP. I DIDN'T GET ANY HELP. AT THAT POINT; ACFT X WAS 10 MI IN THE NEXT SECTOR; STILL IN HDOF STATUS. THE RECEIVING CTLR WOULD NOT ACCEPT IT. TO KEEP THE SIT SAFE; I HAD TO TURN THE ACFT BACK TOWARDS MY AIRSPACE. THE SUPVR RELIEVED THE OTHER CTLR WITH A REPLACEMENT. THE NEW CTLR TOOK THE HDOF AND ACFT X WAS TURNED ON COURSE. THIS INCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF THE RECEIVING CTLR WAS NOT SO STUBBORN.

THIS COULD LEAD TO THE UNLIKELY; BUT POSSIBLE; SCENARIO OF A FLT CREW BEING UNAWARE OF A SYS MALFUNCTION. FOR EXAMPLE: IF A HYD PUMP 'LOW PRESSURE' LIGHT IS ILLUMINATED ON THE OVERHEAD PANEL AND THE FO SIDE SCOREBOARD IS UNSEATED FAR ENOUGH THAT THE HYD LIGHT WILL NOT ILLUMINATE; THEN DEPRESSING THE CAPT SIDE SCOREBOARD TO PERFORM THE RECALL TEST DOES NOT ILLUMINATE THE YELLOW 'MASTER CAUTION' LIGHT. I HAVE FOUND THIS TO BE TRUE ON THE FOLLOWING ACFT (8 ACFT NUMBERS). MY UNSCIENTIFIC TESTING SEEMS TO SHOW THAT THIS IS TRUE ON ABOUT 20-25% OF OUR FLEET.

AS WE WERE CLBING TO 6000 FT; I NOTICED LIGHT RIME ICING. THE ENG ANTI-ICE HAD BEEN ON FOR TKOF; SO I TURNED ON AIR FOIL ANTI-ICING. FOR THAT REASON; THE AFTER TKOF CHKLIST HAD NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED. WE WERE THEN CLRED TO CLB TO 13000 FT. AS THE ACFT BEGAN TO CLB; THE AFT FLT ATTENDANT CALLED TO RPT A LOUD SQUEAL AROUND THE AFT GALLEY. I TOLD THE FO TO LEVEL OFF. AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME; WE WERE PASSING 10000 FT AND THE CABIN ALT AURAL VOCAL SOUNDED. I INSTRUCTED THE FO TO BEGIN A GRADUAL DSCNT. IN THE DSCNT TO 8000 FT; WE NOTICED THE CABIN ALT CTL SELECTOR WAS IN THE MANUAL POS. THE CABIN ALT CTL SELECTOR WAS PLACED IN AUTO TO TRY TO GET CTL OF THE CABIN PRESSURIZATION. THE CABIN FOLLOWED OUR DSCNT AND DID NOT PRESSURIZE IN THE AUTO MODE. I DECIDED TO RETURN TO CVG AND HAVE MAINT CHK THE ACFT RATHER THAN CONTINUE. NO EMER WAS DECLARED. LNDG AND TAXI TO THE GATE WERE UNEVENTFUL. WE SUBSEQUENTLY CHANGED ACFT AND PROCEEDED TO PWM. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1) FATIGUE: A REDUCED LAYOVER IN ATL THE NIGHT BEFORE INTO A LONG DAY OF DEALING WITH WX. THIS WAS A FACTOR IN MISSING THE CHK OF THE CTLR DURING PREFLT. 2) THE PRESSURE TO STAY ON SCHEDULE AFTER RECEIVING THE ACFT LATE DURING PREFLT. 3) SET UP BY MAINT; THE ACFT HAD BEEN PRESSURIZED FOR A MAINT CHK. THE CTLR WAS LEFT IN THE MANUAL MODE FULL OPEN. NIGHT LOOKING AT THE CTLR THE POS OF THE VALVE IS THE SAME AS YOU WOULD NORMALLY FIND IN AUTO MODE.

THIS WAS THE SECOND DAY OF MY 7 DAY ROTATION AND MY IOE CAPT WAS ON 4TH DAY. WE WERE RESTED 8 HRS THE NIGHT BEFORE AND ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT IT WAS OUR 4TH LEG OF THE DAY. AT THIS TIME OUR FLT TIME WAS 4 1/2 HRS. DURING THE LNDG PHASE AT CRQ; ACFT R MAIN TIRE AND WHEEL ASSEMBLY SUSTAINED DAMAGED DUE TO UNKNOWN CAUSES. PRIOR TO DEPARTING BUR; I HAD ASKED THE IOE CAPT IF SHE WAS COMFORTABLE FLYING FROM THE R SEAT. IOE CAPT'S RESPONSE WAS 'YES.' WHILE PROCEEDING INBOUND TO CRQ; THE SOCAL APCH CTLR VECTORED US THROUGH THE ILS RWY LOC AND THEN GAVE US ANOTHER VECTOR TO RE-INTERCEPT. THIS PUT US ABOVE THE GS. THE WX WAS BETTER THAN RPTED 5000 FT BROKEN; 10 MI VISIBILITY; LIGHT RAIN; WINDS WERE 150 DEGS AT 7 KTS; ENABLING US TO ACCEPT THE VISUAL APCH. AS WE SWITCHED FREQ FROM SOCAL TO CRQ TWR; TWR INFORMED US TO SLOW TO 140 KTS DUE TO TFC ON FINAL APCH. ON 3/4 MI FINAL; THE PAPI LIGHTS WERE INDICATING ALL WHITE; GIVING A CLR INDICATION OF BEING TOO HIGH. I STATED; 'WE ARE TOO HIGH.' THE IOE CAPT REPLIED; 'WE'LL MAKE IT.' I BEGAN CALLING VREF AND SINK RATE; WHICH WAS APPROX 1500 FPM. THE IOE CAPT ATTEMPTED TO CORRECT. ABOVE THE LNDG THRESHOLD WITH THE ACFT OBVIOUSLY TOO HIGH; I CALLED VREF -1; -2; -3; +1; +2; +3; ETC; AND THE FIRST STALL WARNING INDICATION CAME ON. THE IOE CAPT CORRECTED BY ADDING PWR AND PITCHING THE NOSE DOWN. SOON AFTER ANOTHER STALL WARNING CAME ON DURING FLARE WHICH WAS APPROX 10 FT ABOVE THE RWY. I WAS CALLING FOR VREF AND SINK RATE WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY WHAT I FELT WAS LNDG IN A STALLED CONDITION. THE RWY WAS DRY WITH A 7 KT 90 DEG XWIND FROM THE L. AFTER MAIN GEAR CONTACT WITH THE RWY; THE ACFT VEERED SHARPLY TOWARD THE R. THE IOE CAPT WAS FIGHTING THE CTLS AS THE ACFT WAS NOW SWINGING R AND L. THE IOE CAPT PUT THE PROPS IN REVERSE IN AN ATTEMPT TO REGAIN DIRECTIONAL CTL. THIS ACFT WHEN PUT INTO REVERSE; HAS A TENDENCY FOR THE R ENG TO GO INTO REVERSE FIRST. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN SYMMETRIC REVERSE THRUST; THIS ACFT REQUIRES THE PWR LEVER TO BE SPLIT 1/2 INCH TO 1 INCH. THE IOE CAPT HAD THE PWR LEVER IN THE PARALLEL POS RESULTING IN ASYMMETRICAL THRUST FAVORING THE R ENG; PULLING THE ACFT TO THE R. AT THIS TIME; THE ACFT WAS SEVERELY VIBRATING; MAINTAINING DIRECTIONAL CTL WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. AS THE ACFT WAS OBVIOUSLY HEADING OFF THE R SIDE OF THE RWY; I APPLIED FULL L RUDDER. AT THIS TIME; DEP OFF THE RWY BECAME IMMINENT; SO I ENGAGED THE STEERING SYS; WHICH ENABLED THE ACFT TO STAY ON THE RWY AND COME TO A COMPLETE STOP. I PERFORMED AN EMER SHUTDOWN TO SECURE AND AVOID FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE ACFT. THE RWY WAS THEN SHUT DOWN AS WE WERE INFORMED BY THE TWR THAT WE HAD BLOWN A R MAIN TIRE. AFTER SECURING THE AIRPLANE; THE ARPT AUTH APCHED US AND ASKED FOR A SIGNATURE FROM THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF THE ACFT. THE IOE CAPT STATED THAT I WAS PIC AND WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACFT. I WAS TOLD TO SIGN FOR THE ACFT'S REMOVAL. I WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE AS I HAD THE UNDERSTANDING THE IOE CAPT WAS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OP OF THE ACFT UNTIL MY LINE TRAINING WAS COMPLETED. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATED THE P180 HAS NO ANTISKID SYS AND HE FELT THAT EXCESSIVE BRAKE APPLICATION AFTER TOUCHDOWN FOLLOWING THE UNSTABILIZED APCH WAS LIKELY THE CAUSE OF THE TIRE FAILURE. RPTR ADVISED THAT HIS RPT TO THE COMPANY SAFETY OFFICER REGARDING THE ACTIONS OF THE IOE CAPT DURING AND SUBSEQUENT TO THIS INCIDENT RESULTED IN THE CAPT'S REMOVAL FROM ALL FLT DUTIES. SHE CONTINUES WITH THE COMPANY IN THE CAPACITY OF A GND INSTRUCTOR.

IN MY OPINION; THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS LED TO THE INCIDENT: LNDG GEAR DOORS HAD JUST BEEN INSTALLED ON THE ACFT. KIT NUMBER XLS-102 IS AN APPROVED KIT FOR THE LA25 SERIES ACFT. WINDS WERE 310 DEGS AT 16 KTS GUSTING TO 25 KTS; THEREFORE; RWY 31 WAS CHOSEN. AS I TURNED FOR A MID L DOWNWIND; I LOWERED MY LNDG GEAR; MY AIRSPD WAS 98 KTS; MAX GEAR EXTENSION IS 107 KTS. I DID NOT HAVE A GREEN LIGHT INDICATING MY LNDG GEAR WAS DOWN. I DID A VISUAL CHK OF THE LNDG GEAR AND ALL LOOKED IN PLACE. AFTER EXAMINING THE LNDG GEAR; IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE GEAR DID NOT LOCK INTO PLACE DUE TO A BENT HYD ACTUATOR. I BELIEVE THE ACTUATOR WAS BENT WHILE THE GEAR WAS BEING EXTENDED; THE L WING WAS HIGH (THEREFORE THE GEAR WAS EXTENDING UPWARD); WITH A 90 DEG WIND GUST OF 25 KTS HITTING THE LNDG GEAR DOOR DURING EXTENSION; MAY HAVE RESULTED IN AN EXCESSIVE LOAD ON THE ACTUATOR. IN ORDER TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE; I WOULD REDUCE GEAR EXTENSION SPD TO 90 KTS; AND LOWER GEAR WHILE ON THE DOWNWIND IN STRAIGHT AND LEVEL FLT. AFTER SECURING THE LNDG GEAR IN THE DOWN POS; I FLEW THE ACFT BACK TO ZZZ1 ARPT THE NEXT MORNING FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE BOTTOM L FLOAT SKIN AND TO REPAIR THE HYD ACTUATOR FOR THE L LNDG GEAR.",,,,"A LAKE RENEGADE INCURRED L WING FLOAT LOWER SKIN DAMAGE WHEN THE L LNDG GEAR RETRACTED DURING TAXI.

AFTER COMPLETING ALL MANEUVERS; THE STUDENT REQUESTED IF HE COULD PRACTICE SOME INST APCHS. THE STUDENT I WAS WITH HOLDS AN INST RATING. WE THEN CONTACTED APCH AND REQUESTED PERMISSION AND RECEIVED AUTH TO PRACTICE INST APCHS AT ZZZ ARPT. APCH PROCEEDED TO GIVE HDGS TO INTERCEPT LOC FOR THE ILS RWY 9R. WE FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN AND PERFORMED A LOW APCH WITH MISSED APCH HDG SW. DURING THIS MANEUVER; THE STUDENT FOLLOWED ALL ESTABLISHED PROCS. WE THEN PROCEEDED TO PERFORM 1 MORE APCH. WE WERE FLYING THE LOC AT THE TIME WE INTERCEPTED THE GS; THE STUDENT PROCEEDED TO PERFORM THE LNDG CHKLIST. I WAS SUPERVISING THAT THE STUDENT WAS FOLLOWING ALL THE LNDG PROCS. THE STUDENT WAS ORALLY STATING EACH STEP OF THE CHKLIST PROCS. I OBSERVED AS HE MOVED THE MIX FORWARD; PROP FORWARD; AND LNDG GEAR DOWN AT THE SAME TIME I LOOKED FOR THE TRANSITION LIGHT. WHEN THE TRANSITION LIGHT TURNED ON; I LOOKED OUTSIDE; CHKING FOR TFC; BECAUSE WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO MAINTAIN VFR AT ALL TIMES. SIMULTANEOUSLY; WE RPTED TO ZZZ TWR THAT WE WERE IN THE OM AND THE TWR TOLD US TO PERFORM A SIDESTEP TO RWY 9L. WE BROKE THE APCH AND PROCEEDED TO RWY 9L. ON FINAL; THE STUDENT SAID GUMP CHK. THE STUDENT THEN PROCEEDED TO VERIFY THE GUMP CHK AND STATED ORALLY 'GAS; UNDERCARRIAGE; 3 GREENS; MIX AND PROP.' I WAS LOOKING FOR TFC AND WE PROCEEDED TO LAND. WHEN WE WERE ON TOP OF THE RWY; I ASKED THE STUDENT 'ARE YOU PLANNING TO LAND?' AND I REALIZED THAT THE LNDG GEAR HAD NOT COME OUT. I PROCEEDED TO CLOSE THE MIX AND FEATHER THE PROP AND HOLD FOR IMPACT. WHEN THE PLANE STOPPED; WE CHKED; AND THE CIRCUIT BREAKER WAS OUT. THAT IS WHY THE LNDG GEAR HAD NOT COME OUT. AFTER THE INCIDENT; I WAS NOTIFIED BY THE OTHER INSTRUCTOR THAT HE HAD THE SAME PROB THE DAY BEFORE BUT HE WAS ABLE TO RESET THE CIRCUIT BREAKER AND THE LNDG GEAR HAD COME DOWN. AFTERWARDS; HE CONDUCTED A TEST FLT; BUT THE PROB DID NOT OCCUR AGAIN. WE HAD THE SAME PROB WITH THIS AIRPLANE APPROX 1 YR AGO AND TOOK IT TO MAINT. THE MECHS CONDUCTED A RETRACTION AND THE PROB DID NOT RESURFACE. THEREFORE; WE CONTINUE TO FLY THE AIRPLANE AND EVERY COUPLE OF FLTS THE PROB REAPPEARED BUT EVERY TIME WE TOOK THE PLANE TO THE REPAIR SHOP AND THE RETRACTION WAS CONDUCTED; THE PROB DID NOT OCCUR AT THAT TIME. FINALLY; AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS AT THE REPAIR SHOP THEY DECIDED TO CHANGE THE BRUSHES IN THE LNDG GEAR MOTOR TO SEE IF THIS WOULD FIX THE PROB.

I WAS VERBALLY INSTRUCTING MY STUDENT AS TO THE ORDER OF EVENTS HE WOULD TAKE WHEN WE REACHED OUR FIRST CHKPOINT (RYN); WHEN I VISUALLY SIGHTED AN F16 XING IN FRONT OF US FROM R TO L AT OUR ALT WITH ABOUT 100 FT HORIZ SEPARATION. AS I HAD THE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS AS CLOSE AS I EVER WANTED TO GET TO AN F16 INFLT; HIS TRAILING WINGMAN CAME INTO VIEW LOCATED MIDWAY BTWN US AND THE FIRST F16. I IMMEDIATELY GRABBED THE CTLS AND PULLED UP IN A SPLIT SECOND DECISION; TO INCREASE VERT SPACING BTWN US THE CLOSEST F16 (IT APPEARED TO BE A FEW FT BELOW US; PROMPTING MY DECISION). IT ONLY TOOK ABOUT 3 SECONDS FROM VISUALLY ACQUIRING THE F16 UNTIL IT PASSED ACROSS OUR NOSE. I ESTIMATE THAT THERE WAS 50 FT HORIZ AND 10 FT VERT SEPARATION WHEN THE CLOSEST F16 CROSSED OUR NOSE. I BELIEVE THAT THE F16'S WERE FLYING AROUND 200 KTS AIRSPD; AND THEY APCHED US FROM THE 2:30 - 3 O'CLOCK POS DUE TO THEIR APCH VECTOR AND CLOSURE RATE; MY STUDENT AND I DID NOT VISUALLY ACQUIRE EITHER ACFT UNTIL ABOUT 3 SECONDS PRIOR TO XING OUR NOSE. THE HIGH WING DESIGN AND WING STRUT OF THE C172 MADE IT DIFFICULT TO VISUALLY ACQUIRE EITHER ACFT ANY SOONER THAN WE DID. ONCE WE RETURNED TO AVQ; I WAS INFORMED THAT THE COMMANDING SAFETY OFFICER FOR THE F16 UNIT HAD PHONED OUR FLT SCHOOL AND TALKED TO MGMNT. THE PLT OF THE F16 HAD RPTED THE CLOSE CALL; AND OUR TAIL NUMBER HAD BEEN OBTAINED FROM RADAR RPTS. LATER ON; THE GENERAL MGR AND I HAD A TELECON WITH THE COMMANDING SAFETY OFFICER TO DISCUSS HOW FUTURE OCCURRENCES LIKE THIS COULD BE AVOIDED. THE CLOSE CALL DID OCCUR ON A KNOWN MIL RTE TO AND FROM THEIR TRAINING AREAS. I KNEW THIS SINCE I HAVE WITNESSED MIL TFC ON THIS RTE ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS. I DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY USE 7500 FT AND 7000 FT MSL DURING THEIR RETURN. I BELIEVE THAT TO AVOID FUTURE CLOSE CALLS; I CAN MAINTAIN STRICTER DILIGENCE IN TFC SCANNING TECHNIQUES WHEN XING KNOWN MIL RTES. SHALLOW S-TURNS TO LOOK UNDER THE WING IN THIS INSTANCE WOULD HAVE HELPED (WHICH I POINTED OUT TO MY STUDENT). ALSO; WE COULD HAVE LOITERED IN A KNOWN SAFE AREA WHILE WE WAITED TO GET OUR FLT PLAN ACTIVATED SO THAT WE COULD HAVE HAD FLT FOLLOWING THROUGH HIGHER TFC AREAS. OUR FLT INSTRUCTORS WILL HAVE A TRAINING SESSION IN THE FUTURE WITH THE SAFETY OFFICER TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE MIL RTES IN THE AREA TO INCREASE SAFETY AWARENESS.",,,,"NMAC OCCURS BTWN C172 AND FLT OF 2 F16'S NEAR TUCSON.",

WE WERE ON A LONG IFR XCOUNTRY FLT. THE ACFT HELD 5 HRS OF FUEL AND THE TIME ENRTE WAS TO BE 4 HRS. ALONG THE RTE; WE EXPERIENCED SOME GREATER THAN PLANNED HEADWINDS WHICH SLOWED OUR GND SPD. AFTER SOME INFLT COMPUTATIONS; WE DETERMINED THAT WE STILL HAD ADEQUATE FUEL TO MAKE IT TO OUR DEST WITH RESERVES. THE MAJORITY OF THE FLT WAS CONDUCTED IN IMC EXCEPT THE LAST 30 MINS WHEN WE ENTERED A BROKEN TO SCATTERED LAYER IN THE VICINITY OF OUR DEST. WE WERE STILL UNDER IFR BUT IN VMC WHEN WE BEGAN THE ILS APCH WITH RADAR VECTORS FROM CTR. APPROX 15 MI FROM THE ARPT; THE ENG BEGAN TO SPUTTER AND STOPPED PRODUCING PWR. WE NOTIFIED CTR AND INFORMED THEM THAT WE WERE GOING TO SET IT DOWN ON A ROAD. THE LNDG WAS UNEVENTFUL AND NO DAMAGE OCCURRED TO THE ACFT OR PROPERTY. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE EVENT WERE THE USE OF CARB HEAT DURING THE FLT WHICH AFTER THE FACT WAS DETERMINED TO USE MORE FUEL. THE GREATER THAN PLANNED WINDS AND THE LESS THAN MINIMUM LNDG CEILINGS ALONG THE RTE PREVENTING A CLOSER FUEL STOP WERE ALL FACTORS. ANOTHER FACTOR HAS TO DO WITH THE CALIBRATION OF THE FUEL DIPSTICK IN THAT IT WAS RECENTLY RE-CALIBRATED TO A GREATER QUANTITY THAN I THOUGHT WAS IN THE FUEL TANK. I WENT AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGEMENT AND USED WHAT WAS SAID ON THE STICK. FINALLY; SINCE I WAS WITH A PVT PLT WHO WAS DOING MOST OF THE FLYING; I ALLOWED HIM TO PERFORM THE PREFLT ON THE ACFT AND CHK FUEL QUANTITIES. I DID NOT DOUBLECHK HIS PREFLT BUT TRUST HIM TO DO A GOOD JOB. CORRECTIVE ACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO MAKE A NO-GO DECISION FROM THE START. WHILE ENRTE; WE DETERMINED THAT OUR GND SPD WAS LESS THAN PLANNED; WE COULD HAVE TURNED AROUND. I SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH MY BETTER JUDGEMENT AND I SHOULD HAVE PERFORMED MY OWN PREFLT. AFTER REVIEWING THE FLT PLANNING; AFTER THE FACT; WE DETERMINED THAT WE HAD PLANNED FOR ENOUGH FUEL. HOWEVER; WITH THE USE OF THE CARB HEAT AND THE AGE OF THE ENG; THE ACFT WAS MOST LIKELY USING MORE FUEL THAN WE HAD PLANNED. AGAIN; THE BEST ACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN NOT TO GO OR TO HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF THE ACTUAL RANGE OF THE ACFT AND THE INACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO LAND SOONER IF WX COOPERATED. THIS WAS A BIT OF A TRAINING FLT FOR THE PVT PLT WHO WAS WITH ME. THE MAJORITY OF MY ATTN WAS IN TEACHING HIM ABOUT FLYING ON INSTS. MY MIND DID NOT THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT THE FUEL SINCE WE PREPLANNED FOR ENOUGH FUEL TO MAKE IT TO OUR DEST PLUS REQUIRED RESERVES.

THIS QUERY WAS IN RESPONSE TO A LETTER OF INVESTIGATION RECEIVED FROM THE LCL FAA PRIMARY MAINT OFFICER. ALTHOUGH I'M NOT PRIVY TO THE DETAILS OF THE LETTER OF INVESTIGATION; MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE FAA IS QUESTIONING THE VALIDITY OF THE PROC CONDUCTED VERSUS THE USE OF MEL 2522C (SEAT(S) INOP) AS PROPER IN THIS INCIDENT. THE FACTS ARE AS FOLLOWS: ACFT Y (DF781) JAN/THU/05. THE SEAT ASSEMBLY AT ROW 5ABC WAS RPTED LOOSE IN THE SEAT FLOOR TRACK. THE LCL ZZZ CONTRACT MECH WAS CONTACTED. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FORWARD INBOARD SEAT LEG WAS INTERNALLY STRIPPED PREVENTING THE SEAT ASSEMBLY FROM BEING PROPERLY SECURED TO THE FLOOR TRACK. THE LACK OF PARTS AND MECH SKILLS PREVENTED A TIMELY FIX IN ZZZ. IT WAS RECENTLY COMMUNICATED TO MAINT CTL THAT MERELY RESTRICTING THE SEATS FROM USE BY THE APPLICATION OF MEL 2522C WAS NO LONGER A VALID RELIEF IN SITS WHERE SEAT ASSEMBLIES WOULD NOT SECURE TO THE FLOOR TRACKS. I DIRECTED THE CONTRACT MECH TO REMOVE THE SEAT ASSEMBLY FROM THE PAX CABIN AND STOW IT IN THE AFT CARGO PIT. I HAD THE MECH PLACARD THE SEAT ASSEMBLY 'DO NOT REMOVE.' I FURTHER INSTRUCTED THE MECH TO MAKE A PLACARD OF SUCH A SIZE AS TO BE OBVIOUS TO RAMP SVC AND TO AFFIX SAID PLACARD IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT WOULD NOT EASILY FALL OFF. THE LIFE VESTS FROM THE SEAT ASSEMBLY WERE STOWED IN THE SPARE LIFE VEST POUCH. ALL ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS WERE CAPPED AND STOWED. SOMETIME IN 2004; CONCERNS WERE RAISED BY THE FAA REGARDING THE WT AND BAL WHEN REMOVING SEAT ASSEMBLIES FROM THE PAX CABIN. PROCS WERE ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPANY TO HAVE THE WT AND BAL COMPUTATIONS ALTERED BY OPS ENGINEERING REFLECTING THE REMOVAL OF SEAT ASSEMBLIES. FURTHER; SUBSEQUENT CONCERNS WERE RAISED IN REGARDS TO THE LIFE VESTS INSTALLED UNDERNEATH THE SEATS AS BEING HAZMAT WHEN PLACED IN THE CARGO COMPARTMENT. DF781 DOCUMENTS THE SPECIFICS THAT I TOOK FOR THE REMOVAL AND STOWAGE OF THE SEAT ASSEMBLY AS WELL AS THE COMPLIANCE OF THE WT AND BAL AND LIFE VEST ISSUES. SPECIFIC DIRECTIONS WERE PROVIDED THAT THE SEAT ASSEMBLY WAS 'NOT TO BE REMOVED' FROM THE ACFT AND ITS PRESENCE WAS TO BE CHKED AT EACH STATION ALONG WITH INFORMING THE STATION LOAD PLANNER OF THE 115 LB SEAT ASSEMBLY IN THE AFT PIT. THIS DIRECTION WAS REINFORCED BY THE INCLUSION OF AN AUTO-GENERATING LOG WRITE-UP AT EACH STATION REQUIRING A SIGNOFF. FINALLY; SPECIFIC DIRECTION WAS GIVEN TO CONTACT OPS ENGINEERING (ACCOMPANIED BY THE PHONE NUMBER) OF MAINT CTL (IF THE REPAIR WAS ACCOMPLISHED ON A WKEND) WHEN THE SEAT ASSEMBLY WAS REINSTALLED SO THAT THE WT AND BAL COMPUTATIONS COULD BE RETURNED TO ITS ORIGINAL CONFIGN. THE ABOVE PROC IS NOT EXCLUSIVE TO MYSELF NOR MAINT CTL BUT HAS BEEN A LONGSTANDING AND COMMON; ALBEIT EVOLVING; APPLICATION OF THE MEL IN SIMILAR SITS; ACROSS ALL FLEET TYPES. THIS PROC PRE-DATES MY EMPLOYMENT (AUG/85). MY ACTIONS DO NOT REFLECT WILLFUL DISREGARD OR NEGLIGENCE AS I WAS UNAWARE OF ANY CHANGES TO THIS LONGSTANDING PRACTICE.

ON THE FIRST DISCREPANCY; THE PLT POINTED OUT THAT A TUBE EXTENDING FROM THE R WINGTIP WAS COMPLETELY BLOCKED WITH FOREIGN MATERIAL. I MADE A MENTAL NOTE TO INVESTIGATE THE FUNCTION OF THE SUBJECT TUBE. I HAD PREVIOUSLY CHKED FOR BLOCKAGE IN A SMALLER TUBE UNDER THE SAME WING AND INCORRECTLY ASSUMED THAT WAS THE FUEL VENT TUBE. I ALSO LOOKED AT ANOTHER C337 OF A DIFFERENT YR AND DID NOT SEE A TUBE EXTENDING FROM EITHER WINGTIP; SO I INCORRECTLY ASSUMED THE TUBE IN THE SUBJECT ACFT WAS LEFT OVER FROM A PREVIOUS MODIFICATION. ABOUT THIS SAME TIME; SEVERAL OTHER DISCREPANCIES SURFACED THAT DELAYED THE PLT FROM TAKING THE ACFT AT THE PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED TIME AND I SIMPLY FORGOT TO RESEARCH THE REASON FOR THE TUBE PROTRUDING FROM THE WINGTIP.

WHILE THE TWR'S MIKE WAS STILL KEYED; AN ACR JET OVERTOOK ME AND PASSED IN FRONT OF ME; BARELY MISSING ME. I NOTED THAT THE ACFT WAS DSNDING SHARPLY IN A L TURN. THE ACR JET HAD COME FROM MY 4-5 O'CLOCK POS ABOVE ME. AFTER THE ACR JET PASSED ME; I CALLED THE TWR BACK AND INFORMED THEM THAT I WAS NOW COMING UP ON 3 MI L BASE FOR RWY 10 AND THAT AN ACR JET HAD ALMOST HIT ME; AND THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ME TO EXECUTE ANY COLLISION AVOIDANCE MANEUVERS WHILE THE JET WAS PASSING ME. WHEN THE CTLR CALLED BACK HE SOUNDED SHAKY AND TOLD ME TO TURN 90 DEGS TO THE R AND EXTEND MY DOWNWIND LEG AND THAT HE WOULD CALL MY L BASE. I RESPONDED AND MANEUVERED ACCORDINGLY. HE CALLED MY L BASE AND CLRED ME TO LAND #1. AS I WAS ROLLING OUT; HE INSTRUCTED ME TO EXIT AT THE NEXT INTXN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE ANOTHER ACFT WAS LNDG RIGHT BEHIND ME. AS I EXITED THE RWY; I WATCHED A CESSNA LAND JUST AS I WAS CLRING THE RWY. THAT WAS TOO CLOSE FOR MY COMFORT.

WHEN I REACHED DOWN TO PUSH THE IDENT BUTTON ON THE RADIO TUNING UNIT (RTU) I ACCIDENTALLY PUSHED THE FREQUENCY FLIP BUTTON AND UNKNOWINGLY SWITCHED BACK TO THE TWR FREQ. I THEN NOTICED AN ACFT ON TCAS THAT APPEARED TO BE ON THE ILS APCH TO RWY 30 AND DSNDING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF OUR DEP TRACK. HEARING NOTHING FROM WHAT I THOUGHT WAS DEP I MADE A QUERY ABOUT THE HEAD-ON TFC. I THEN SUDDENLY REALIZED WHAT HAPPENED AND SWITCHED BACK TO DEP. WE WERE IMMEDIATELY ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS TO TURN 100 DEGS TO THE R. I NOTICED THAT THE ACFT ON THE APCH WAS FIVE MI AND AT THE SAME ALT AND CLOSING RAPIDLY. AS WE CLRED THE AREA TO THE W; APCH ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS TO THE OTHER ACFT TO REJOIN THE LOC AND RE-CLRED HIM FOR THE APCH. I OBVIOUSLY MISSED A VECTOR WHILE I WAS OFF FREQ AND CAUSED THE OTHER ACFT TO ALMOST GAR. I BELIEVE THAT ATC FELT PRESSURE TO RELEASE US DUE TO THE VOID TIME AND WAS TRYING TO GET US AIRBORNE EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS AN ACFT BEGINNING THE APCH IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. THE TIMING OF ACCIDENTALLY SWITCHING OFF FREQUENCY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN AT A WORSE TIME. IF I DIDN'T NOTICE THE OTHER ACFT ON TCAS I PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE DISCOVERED MY MISTAKE RIGHT AWAY. THIS SCENARIO COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF WE HAD TAKEN OFF ON ANOTHER RWY OR BEEN MADE TO WAIT FOR THE OTHER ACFT TO LAND REGARDLESS OF THE VOID TIME. AT 1500 FT AGL IN IMC AT NIGHT IS A BUSY TIME WITH CALLOUTS; FREQ CHANGES; ETC AND AN EASY TIME TO GET DISTRACTED. THE IDENT BUTTON ON THIS ACFT IS LOCATED RIGHT NEXT TO AND IS ALMOST THE SAME SHAPE AS THE FREQ FLIP BUTTON. IN THE PAST I HAVE WITNESSED OTHER PLTS MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE BUT NEVER AT SUCH A CRITICAL TIME. RELOCATING BUTTONS AWAY FROM THE FREQ FLIP BUTTON WOULD HELP AVOID THIS HAPPENING AGAIN.

PERHAPS A MINUTE LATER I DETECTED A FLASHING LIGHT IN MY L PERIPHERAL VISION; AND LOOKED AT MY INSTRUMENT PANEL. THE AMBER ALT ALERTER LIGHT ON MY ALTIMETER WAS FLASHING; AND I SAW THAT THE RED AUTOPLT #1 FAIL LIGHT WAS FLASHING TOO.

WE DISCUSSED THE INCIDENT AND THE CAPT SAID HE THOUGHT THE AUTOPLT DROPPED OFF WHEN; AFTER HE HAD TURNED TO 290 DEG HDG; HE HAD USED THE #1 COMPASS SET HDG KNOB TO TRY TO RESYNCHRONIZE HIS MAGNETIC COMPASS TO THE CORRECT HDG. HE THEN TURNED THE HDG SET KNOB; AND VERIFIED THAT IT MADE THE #1 AUTOPLT DROP OFF. THERE WAS NOT AURAL WARNING WHEN IT DROPPED OFF; AND WE DETERMINED THAT BRIGHT SUNLIGHT ENTERING THE COCKPIT OVER HIS L SHOULDER HAD WASHED OUT THE AMBER AND RED WARNING LIGHTS ON HIS INSTRUMENT PANEL SO HE DIDN'T SEE THEM.

THE STUDENT WAS IN THE R SEAT; I WAS IN THE L. WE WERE TRACKING TO THE BOILER VOR FROM THE N IN ORDER TO PRACTICE A VOR HOLD. THE STUDENT WAS WEARING A VIEW-LIMITING HOOD; AND THE ALT INDICATOR AND DIRECTIONAL GYRO HAD BEEN COVERED WITH PIECES OF PAPER TO SIMULATE A VACUUM SYS FAILURE. A STRONG WIND ALOFT (FORECASTED AS 310 DEGS AT 30 KTS) HAD CONTRIBUTED TO US BEING SLIGHTLY E OF BOILER AS WE CROSSED THE VOR. I LEANED BACK AND LOOKED OUT THE R WINDOW TO VISUALLY SEE OUR LOCATION WITH RESPECT TO THE VOR. AS I WAS DOING THIS; THE STUDENT INDICATED SHE WAS NOTING THE TIME ON THE ACFT CLOCK AND BEGINNING THE 1 MIN TURN TO ENTER THE HOLD. GLANCING AT THE ACFT CLOCK MUST HAVE ALLOWED MY STUDENT TO SEE OUTSIDE ENOUGH TO NOTICE ANOTHER AIRPLANE CONVERGING FROM ABOUT OUR 10 O'CLOCK POS; APCHING NEARLY HEAD-ON. THE STUDENT LOOKED UP; EXCLAIMED THAT SHE SAW AN AIRPLANE AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN A STEEP R TURN AWAY FROM THE OTHER ACFT. I LOOKED FORWARD AND THEN L JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE OTHER ACFT PASS TO OUR L AND SLIGHTLY BELOW US. THE ACFT WAS A LIGHT TWIN SIMILAR TO A SENECA OR BARON. WE WERE COMMUNICATING WITH THE LAF ATCT DURING OUR DEP AND HAD MONITORED THE FREQ LISTENING FOR OTHER TFC FROM LAF THAT MIGHT BE IN THE AREA. I DID NOT ANNOUNCE THAT WE WOULD BE PRACTICING A HOLD OVER BOILER -- SOMETHING I NORMALLY DO. IT DID NOT APPEAR THIS OTHER ACFT WAS PART OF THE LCL TRAINING FLEETS AS WE NEVER HEARD ANY RADIO XMISSIONS OF RECEIVED ANY ADVISORIES INDICATING THIS ACFT WOULD BE IN THE AREA. BOILER VOR IS 10 NM FROM THE LAFAYETTE ARPT; SO THIS ACFT NEED NOT HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH LAF TWR. WITH POOR RADAR COVERAGE FROM ZAU AND NO RADAR SVCS AVAILABLE AT LAF ATCT; IT IS UNLIKELY EITHER ACFT COULD HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE OTHER'S PRESENCE BY ATC. I FEEL MY INATTN TO VISUALLY SCANNING FOR TFC; ALTHOUGH MOMENTARY; IS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THIS OCCURRENCE. I ALSO FEEL SEVERAL OTHER FACTORS CONTRIBUTED: 1) LACK OF RADAR SVCS AT LAF PREVENTED A POSSIBLE TA BEING ISSUED TO ME. 2) POOR RADAR COVERAGE BELOW 5000 FT FOR ZAU MAY HAVE PREVENTED A TA FROM BEING ISSUED TO THE OTHER ACFT (IF HE OR SHE WAS COMMUNICATING WITH ZAU). 3) THE AREA OF INTENSIVE FLT TRAINING OPS THAT EXISTS AROUND THE LAF ARPT; INCLUDING THE BOILER VOR; IS NOT CHARTED ON ANY AERO CHARTS. 4) NEITHER THE OTHER ACFT NOR I ANNOUNCED TO LAF ATCT THAT WE WERE APCHING THE BOILER VOR. NO PROC EXISTS TO ANNOUNCE YOUR POS AS YOU NEAR BOILER; IT IS A COMMON LCL PRACTICE. LAF IS HOME TO OVER 35 TRAINING ACFT BELONGING EITHER TO THE UNIVERSITY OR THE FBO'S FLT SCHOOL. MOST OF THESE ACFT FLY MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY WHICH OFTEN RESULTS IN OVER 8 ACFT IN THE TFC PATTERN; A FEW ON PRACTICE INST APCHS; AND A FEW MORE ARRIVING OR DEPARTING. THE LAF ATCT DOES AN OUTSTANDING JOB KEEPING TRACK OF EVERYONE AND ISSUING TA'S WHEN POSSIBLE.

MY PRIMARY MEANS OF NAV WAS USER WAYPOINTS FOR VORS AND ARPTS OF INTENDED LNDG; AND PILOTAGE USING WAC AND LOW ALT ENRTE CHARTS. 5) I AM A CURRENT INST PLT; ROUTINELY FLY IMC; AND AM PROFICIENT WITH INST PROCS. ALL OF MY FLYING IS IN THE UNITED STATES SYS. IN HINDSIGHT; MY WEAKEST TECHNIQUES ARE THE VOR APCHS BECAUSE IN THE UNITED STATES I PRIMARILY USE THE ILS AND GPS APCHS. 6) ALTHOUGH I LEARNED VOR TRACKING AND APCH PROCS; I HAVE FLOWN ONLY APCHS USING THE VISUAL DEPICTION OF THE GPS AND NOW REALIZE THAT I AM DEPENDENT ON THIS GPS FOR SPATIAL ORIENTATION.

I HAD MORE THAN AN HOUR AND A HALF WORTH OF FUEL REMAINING; SO I CONTINUED ON TO MY ALTERNATE 50 MI AWAY. WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS ALSO FOGGED IN. THE NEXT CLOSEST ARPT WAS ZZZ; 70 MI AWAY. THE AWOS AT ZZZ WAS RPTING 200 FT CEILINGS AND 2 MI VISIBILITY. I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH FUEL LEFT TO MAKE IT; SO I HAD TO LAND. I'M CURRENTLY WORKING ON MY INSTRUMENT RATING; SO I HAD THE TRAINING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE FOG; BUT I'VE NEVER FLOWN IN IMC AND I WAS TERRIFIED TO DO SO. HOWEVER; THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE I COULD DO. THE LNDG WAS SMOOTH AND UNEVENTFUL THANKS IN GREAT PART TO A MOVING MAP GPS SYSTEM I HAVE INSTALLED IN MY PLANE. WHEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD TO LAND IN IMC CONDITIONS; KNOWING THAT PLTS WITH MORE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE THAN ME; HAVE BEEN KILLED IN SIMILAR SITS; I WAS REALLY KICKING MYSELF FOR GETTING INTO THAT SIT. BUT I COULDN'T IMMEDIATELY THINK OF ANYTHING I HAD DONE WRONG. SINCE THEN I'VE HAD A LOT OF TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT AND I'VE DECIDED THERE WERE SEVERAL FACTORS THAT GOT ME INTO THAT SIT. BY FAR THE BIGGEST THING FACTORING INTO IT WAS SIMPLY LACK OF EXPERIENCE. WHEN I GOT TO BAM AND SAW THE FOG; THE IDEA THAT THE FOG MIGHT STRETCH ON FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES; NEVER ENTERED MY MIND. IF I HAD THOUGHT THERE WAS EVEN A CHANCE THE FOG MIGHT COVER THE ENTIRE STATE; I COULD EASILY HAVE TURNED AROUND AND FUELED UP IN OTHER ARPTS. HOWEVER; LACK OF EXPERIENCE WASN'T THE ONLY PROB. ANOTHER FACTOR WAS MY GPS SYSTEM; WHICH MAKES NAV A NO BRAINER. IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE GPS SYSTEM; I WOULD HAVE (AND SHOULD HAVE EVEN WITH IT) PREPARED AND FILED A VERY DETAILED FLT PLAN AND WHEN FSS GAVE ME THE WX BRIEFING I WOULD HAVE DISCOVERED THE FOG. SO I LEARNED THAT FOG IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY. IT'S NOT SHOWN ON A LOT OF WX CHARTS; SO IT'S EASY TO MISS IF YOU DON'T SPEND ENOUGH TIME FLT PLANNING. ALSO IT'S EASY TO GET LAX WITH TODAY'S ADVANCED AVIONICS. YOU MIGHT THINK THAT YOU HAVE ALL THE INFO YOU NEED; AND THERE'S NO NEED TO DO A TRADITIONAL DETAILED FLT PLAN; AND 99% OF THE TIME YOU'LL GET AWAY WITH IT.

IN THIS ACFT; THE FUEL PRESSURE HAD ALWAYS BEEN STEADY IN THE GREEN REGION. I WAS INTENDING TO LAND ANYWAY; SO CONTINUED THE APCH. WHEN THE ELECTRIC FUEL PUMP WAS TURNED ON; THE VIBRATION CONTINUED; BUT THE AVERAGE PRESSURE ROSE SLIGHTLY. IN THIS ACFT THE ELECTRIC FUEL PUMP HAD NEVER CAUSED THE FUEL GAUGE TO RISE OR TO MOVE IN ANY WAY. IN SUMMARY; 2 DIFFERENCES FROM NORMAL: A RAPID VIBRATION; AND A SLIGHT RISE WHEN THE ELECTRIC FUEL PUMP WAS TURNED ON ALONG WITH CONTINUED VIBRATION. AFTER LNDG; I ASKED THE LCL MECH TO COME AND LOOK AT THE INDICATIONS. HE CLBED INTO THE COCKPIT AND OBSERVED THE SYMPTOMS. THEN WE SHUT DOWN THE ENG AND ATTEMPTED A RESTART (WITH ELECTRIC FUEL PUMP OFF AS PER NORMAL PROC). AS THE ENG TURNED OVER ON STARTER PWR; THE FUEL PRESSURE WAS SEEN TO JUMP UP AND THEN FALL COMPLETELY TO ZERO IN RAPID SUCCESSION. THE MECH'S CONCLUSION (WHICH WAS CORRECT UPON DISASSEMBLY) WAS THAT ONE SIDE OF THE FUEL PUMP HAD FAILED AND THAT THE OTHER SIDE WAS PUMPING FUEL. WHAT WAS UNKNOWN FROM THE COCKPIT; HOWEVER; WAS THAT THE DIAPHRAGM BTWN THE FUEL SYS AND THE ACCESSORY BOX IN THE ENG HAD RUPTURED AND THAT FUEL WAS BEING PUMPED DIRECTLY INTO THE ACCESSORY SECTION. THE OIL TANK; WHICH HAD BEEN AT 7 QUARTS UPON TKOF 1 HR OR SO BEFORE AT TKOF; NOW CONTAINED 10 QUARTS OF HIGHLY DILUTED OIL. 2 OTHER FACTS: 1) I DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW LONG THE GAUGE HAD BEEN VIBRATING BEFORE I NOTICED IT ABOUT 5 MINS BEFORE LNDG. 2) THE ACFT HAD HAD AN OIL CHANGE ONLY 2 FLT HRS BEFORE; YET THE MECH SAID THE OIL WAS VERY DIRTY ('AS DIRTY AS 50 HR OIL'); INDICATING THAT THE GASOLINE HAD ACTED AS A SOLVENT FOR ANY 'DIRTY' PARTS OF THE ENG. AT BEST; THE DILUTED OIL WAS NOT GOOD FOR THE ENG. I DO NOT KNOW THE EXTENT OF ANY FIRE HAZARD. I AM TOLD THAT IF THE FLT HAD CONTINUED; THE GASOLINE/OIL MIXTURE WOULD BE DRAINED OUT OF THE BREATHER TUBE UNDERNEATH THE ACFT. BUT IT WOULD BECOME MORE AND MORE DILUTED AS TIME PROGRESSED WITH POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO THE ENG; NOT TO MENTION THE EFFECT ON RANGE DUE TO THE LOSS OF THE FUEL.

I THINK MOST PLTS; WHO HAVE NOT HAD THIS EXPERIENCE; WOULD ALSO; WITH UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS. THE EXPERIENCED MECH SAID THAT IN HIS ENTIRE EXPERIENCE OF DECADES; THIS WAS THE SECOND FAILURE OF A FUEL PUMP. IN MY APPROX 7000 HRS; MUCH IN MULTIPLE ENGS; IT IS MY FIRST. THIS IS A RARE BUT POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS FAILURE. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATED THAT THE FUEL PUMP IN QUESTION WAS INSTALLED ON A LYCOMING IO-360 ENG.

CLOSE IN ON THE APCH; WE WERE ISSUED A HDG TO INTERCEPT THE FINAL APCH COURSE TO VOR DME #3; RWY 20; A DIFFERENT APCH THAN WE HAD BRIEFED AND PROGRAMMED. THIS NECESSITATED REPROGRAMMING THE FMS AND EXPEDITING THE DSCNT. THIS NEW APCH WAS A RADAR VECTORED APCH TO THE FINAL APCH COURSE. THEREFORE; WE DID NOT HAVE THE EXTRA 16 MILES TO DSND; AS STATED EARLIER; FOR THE ORIGINAL EXPECTED APCH. AT THE MISSED APCH POINT WE EXECUTED A MISSED APCH.

APPROX 30 MI S OF THE ARPT; WE WERE CLRED DIRECTLY TO CAASS INTXN; WHICH IS A WAYPOINT ON THE ILS RWY 24L APCH. APPROX 10 MI FROM THE ARPT; THE FINAL APCH CTLR INSTRUCTED US TO EXPECT ILS RWY 6R. HE THEN VECTORED US OFF OF OUR COURSE AND GAVE US A HDG TO JOIN THE LOC FOR RWY 6R JUST OUTSIDE OF THE OM. IN A RUSH TO REPROGRAM THE MCDU AND GET THE ACFT DOWN AND SLOWED TO SAFELY LAND ON RWY 6R; I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT TO GET MAX FLT SPOILER EXTENSION AND HAD THE FO QUICKLY BRIEF THE IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE ILS RWY 6R APCH. THIS LAST MIN CHANGE CAUSED A MINOR ERROR CHAIN. APCHING THE GREEN LINE ON THE NAV DISPLAY; INDICATING THE FINAL APCH COURSE; I FINALLY NOTICED THE ABSENCE OF LOC AND GS INDICATIONS ON THE PFD. I ASKED THE FO TO VERIFY WITH THE APCH/TWR CTLR THAT THEY HAD FLIPPED THE SWITCH TO TURN ON THE ILS RWY 6R AND AT THE SAME TIME VISUALLY ACQUIRED THE RWY AND SAW US GOING THROUGH THE EXTENDED CTRLINE. WE RPTED THE FIELD IN SIGHT; HE RPTED A NEW ATIS AND VFR CONDITIONS; CLRED US FOR A VISUAL APCH; ADMITTED AND APOLOGIZED FOR NOT HAVING THE APCH SWITCHED AROUND FROM RWY 24L TO RWY 6R. WHILE ALL OF THIS WAS HAPPENING; I WAS ASKING FOR CONFIGN CHANGES WITH FLAPS AND GEAR TO GET STABILIZED FOR LNDG. AT THE POINT THAT I REQUESTED 'MANAGED SPD' THE MAGENTA SPD INDICATOR SHOT UP TO 250 KTS. THE THRUST CAME UP ACCORDINGLY AND WE CAME WITHIN 15 KTS OF OVERSPDING THE FLAPS BEFORE I PULLED THE SPD KNOB TO GIVE US A SELECTED SPD. THIS OCCURRED BECAUSE WE SKIPPED THE 'ACTIVATE/CONFIRM' PORTION OF THE APCH BRIEFING AND DID NOT HAVE THE FMGS SEQUENCED PROPERLY. THESE ERRORS WERE CAUGHT IN TIME TO PREVENT AN INCIDENT BUT WERE VERY MUCH AVOIDABLE. THE CTLR FAILED TO DO HIS JOB PROPERLY POSSIBLY BECAUSE HE WAS OVER-TASKED WITH COVERING ALL OF THE COMS FREQS (APCH; TWR; AND GND) AT XA00. AS A FLT CREW; WE FELL INTO THE TRAP OF RUSHING TO ACCOMMODATE ATC AND DID NOT FOLLOW ALL AIRBUS SOP'S REGARDING INST APCHS. AS AN ASIDE; A VERY SIMILAR CASE OCCURRED TO ME GOING INTO CMH OVER 1 YR AGO EARLY IN THE MORNING WITH SOME OF THE SAME CONDITIONS. THE CTLR WAS OPERATING ALL FREQS; THE ARPT WAS CHANGING DIRECTIONS OF LNDG TFC; AND THE CTLR FAILED TO FLIP THE SWITCH TO TURN ON THE APPROPRIATE NAVAID FOR THE ILS WHILE WE WERE IN IMC.",,,,"A320 FLT CREW FAILS TO PROPERLY SEQUENCE THE FMGS ON FINAL APCH DUE TO LAST MIN RWY CHANGE AND CTLR FAILURE TO ACTIVATE ILS FOR THE NEW RWY AT CLE.",

PART C OF THE COMPANY PRODUCED ENGINEERING ORDER WAS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED. THE PANELS ON THE ACFT WERE OPENED FOR ACCESS OF THE AILERON PWR CTL ACTUATORS.

THE PROVIDED SVC BULLETIN SHOWED THE EFFECTIVE AIR FRAME MANUFACTURER SERIAL NUMBERS AND PWR CTL ACTUATOR EFFECTIVE PART NUMBERS.

I RESPONDED THAT WE WERE FLYING THE MAXXO 1. THE CTLR ASKED US TO STAND BY; THEN CAME BACK A FEW SECONDS LATER AND ASKED US IF WE HAD BEEN ISSUED THE SJN 3; AND ASKED US TO CHK TO SEE IF THAT DEP HAD BEEN ISSUED ON THE PDC. I LOOKED AT THE PDC AND SURE ENOUGH; THE SJN 3 HAD BEEN ISSUED AS A REVISED SEGMENT. HOWEVER; WHEN I REALIZED WHAT HAD HAPPENED; AND MENTIONED IT TO THE CAPT; HE ORDERED ME TO TELL THE CTLR THAT WE DIDN'T SEE 'IT' (THE SJN 3 CLRNC) ON THE PDC ISSUED CLRNC. REALIZING IT WAS IMPRUDENT TO ENGAGE IN AN ALTERCATION WITH THE CAPT DURING A CRITICAL PHASE OF FLT; I FOLLOWED THE CAPT'S ORDER AND TOLD THE CTLR THAT WE DIDN'T SEE IT. THE CTLR THEN ISSUED A HDG WHICH TURNED US BACK TO THE N. MOMENTS LATER; HE TURNED US TO THE E THEN RECLRED US TO JOIN THE SJN 3 SID. I ASKED THE CTLR IF THERE WAS AN 'ISSUE' WITH WHAT HAD OCCURRED; AND HE SAID 'NO.' I ASKED HIM A SIMILAR QUESTION AS HE WAS HANDING US OFF TO THE CTR; AND HE SAID (I'M PARAPHRASING) 'NO PROB; HAVE A NICE DAY.' ONCE THINGS SETTLED DOWN AND WE ESTABLISHED IN A NON-CRITICAL PHASE OF FLT; I CONFRONTED THE CAPT. I REMINDED HIM THAT ATC HAS THE ABILITY TO CONFIRM WHAT THEY SENT US AND IN FACT THE ACARS XMISSION WHICH BROUGHT US THE PDC CLRNC WOULD LIKELY BE TRACEABLE VIA THE ACARS SVC. I TOLD HIM THAT WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF ADMITTING THE OMISSION OF THE REVISED SEGMENT AND TAKING OUR LUMPS. HE DID NOT AGREE WITH MY STATEMENT AND WANTED TO REMAIN SILENT ON THE ERROR. I WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH HIS DECISION; AND STILL AM; THUS THE SUBMISSION OF THIS RPT. I HAD NO INTENTION OF DECEIVING THE CTLR; ESPECIALLY WHEN I KNEW GOOD AND WELL THAT HE HAD THE ABILITY TO 'BUST US' IF HE WANTED TO. BUT IN ORDER TO AVOID THE CONFLICT OF AN INSUBORDINATE SIT DURING A CRITICAL PHASE OF FLT; I ACTED IN A MANNER DIRECTED BY THE CAPT. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE MISSED THE REVISED SEGMENT DURING PREFLT PREPARATION; OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT WE WERE 'PREPROGRAMMED' TO EXPECT MAXXO DEP. IT WAS ON THE RELEASE; IT WAS THE FILED FLT PLAN; AND IT WAS WHAT WAS IN THE 'CANNED' COMPUTER FLT PLAN LOADED INTO THE COMPUTER WHEN IT WAS AUTO UPLINKED VIA ACARS. WHEN THE CLRNC WAS RECEIVED VIA ACARS; IT INDICATED THE FILED FLT PLAN WAS TO INCLUDE THE 'MAXXO 1' BUT WE MUST HAVE BOTH LOOKED RIGHT THROUGH OR PAST THE REVISED SEGMENT. WE EACH ENSURED THAT THE PROGRAMMING WAS 'CORRECT;' LEG BY LEG AS WE HAD ANTICIPATED IT TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CLRNC WE BELIEVED TO BE CORRECT; AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FILED FLT PLAN. I CONSIDER BOTH PLTS INVOLVED TO BE PROFESSIONAL AND CONSCIENTIOUS. WE WERE NOT FATIGUED AS THIS WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY LEG OF THE DAY AFTER A RELATIVELY LONG OVERNIGHT. THE OUTBOUND FLT WE WERE OPERATING WAS RUNNING ABOUT 20 MINS LATE; BUT I NEVER GOT THE FEELING THAT WE WERE RUSHED IN ANY OF OUR ACTIVITIES DURING OUR PREPARATION FOR FLT. NEITHER OF US RECOGNIZED THE REVISED SEGMENT IN THE PDC. WE FOLLOWED PROCS; TOOK OUR TIME; AND ATTEMPTED TO MAKE SURE WE HAD EVERYTHING SET UP CORRECTLY BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW; THE COMPUTER; WHICH WAS GOING TO FLY THE NAV DEP ON AUTOPLT; IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE 'GARBAGE' PROGRAMMED INTO IT. EVERYTHING WAS PROGRAMMED PROPERLY BASED ON WHAT WE BELIEVED TO BE THE CORRECT CLRNC. AS A SUGGESTION; SHOULD A PDC CONTAIN A REVISED SEGMENT; THE SYS SHOULD NOT ALLOW FOR AN AUTOMATIC RECEIPT OF THAT CLRNC. THERE WOULD BE FAR LESS OF A CHANCE OF MISSING A REVISED SEGMENT RECEIVED FROM A CLRNC DELIVERY CTLR WHO STATES THE DEP/TRANSITION DIRECTLY TO YOU VIA A VERBAL XMISSION. IT WOULD STAND OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB IF HE WERE TO SAY SOMETHING OTHER THAN WHAT THE PLTS ARE EXPECTING TO HEAR. HAVING A CLRNC PRESENTED VIA ACARS IS GREAT UNLESS THERE IS A REVISED SEGMENT. IT DOES NOT STAND OUT; AND CAN BE MISSED. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN; BUT IT DOES HAPPEN. NO CONFLICT WITH OTHER TFC WAS NOTED BY THE CREW OR THE CTLR DURING THE PERIOD OF 'CONFUSION.'",,,,"AN A319 CREW FAILED TO SEE A REVISION TO THEIR FLT PLAN DELIVERED VIA ACARS FLT PLAN REVISION FORMAT.",

TWO ACFT CALLED ON GND FREQ FOR TAXI CLRNC TO THE RWY AND AN IFR CLRNC WAS BEING READ TO AN AWAITING ACFT. I WAS ABLE TO SQUEEZE A 'ACFT X ABEAM' BUT THAT WAS ALL.

NO ACFT CALLED FOR TKOF CLRNC OR WERE EVEN WAITING FOR TKOF. I BELIEVE WHP HAS A SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TWR IS MANNED AND RUN ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. HAD THE SECOND MAN IN THE CAB HANDLED THE GND AND CLRNC DUTIES; THE TWR CTLR WOULD HAVE BEEN TALKING TO ME AND MY 'ABEAM' CALL WOULD HAVE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED.

TWO MONTHS AGO A CESSNA 152 CRASHED UPON LNDG. AN ACFT WAITING TO TKOF ASKED THE TWR IF THE ARPT WAS GOING TO BE CLOSED. THE TWR ASKED; 'WHY?' THE ACFT TOLD THE TWR AN ACFT HAD CRASHED ON A BOTCHED LNDG ATTEMPT.

CONDITIONS WERE NO WINDS AND THERE WERE NO OTHER AIRPLANES IN THE PATTERN OR APCHING THE ARPT; SO HE ATTEMPTED A LNDG ON THE N RWY. HIS AIRSPD WAS 5 KTS TOO FAST AND HE WAS TOO HIGH; SO HE INITIATED A GAR AND MANEUVERED FOR A DOWNWIND TO THE S RWY. I CHKED ATIS FOR AN ARPT 10 MI TO THE E; AND CONDITIONS WERE ALTIMETER 30.14 AND WINDS 150 DEGS AT 5 KTS.

HE LANDED SAFELY ON THE NUMBERS AT FULL STALL; THEN BALLOONED. HE LOST CTL OF THE AIRPLANE AND DRIFTED TO THE E SIDE OF THE RWY; WHERE THERE IS AN OPEN GRASS AREA THE LENGTH OF THE RWY AND ABOUT 500 FT WIDE; WITH SHRUBS LINING THE FAR SIDE.

AFTER HIS UNSTABLE APCH; I AGAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE CTLS; DONE A GAR; AND LANDED. 2) THE PLT WAS CURRENT; BUT NOT PROFICIENT.

THE DEP OF OUR TWO-SHIP FORMATION WAS DELAYED APPROX ONE HOUR DUE TO TXWY CLOSURES AND THAT PRESSED US FOR ENOUGH DAYLIGHT; AND ALSO THE PROSPECT OF A DEEPENING MARINE LAYER AT OUR HOME ARPT. THE LATEST WX WAS 4100 FT BROKEN WITH VISIBILITIES OF 10-15 MILES. OUR PLAN WAS TO FOLLOW THE HWY THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE CONDITIONS ON THE DSCNT TO SEE IF THE CEILING WOULD ALLOW A SAFE MARGIN TO GET UNDER THE CLOUD LAYER AS THE MOUNTAIN SLOPE REACHED THE VALLEY. FLT CONDITIONS E OF THE MOUNTAIN SUMMIT WERE EXCELLENT WITH UNLIMITED CEILINGS AND VISIBILITY. FROM THE SUMMIT W THE SIT DETERIORATED TO SCATTERED TO BROKEN WITH 5-10 MILE VISIBILITIES. ABOUT 35 MILES E OF ZZZ; WE HEARD ANOTHER FORMATION ON OUR FORMATION FREQ AND IT WAS APPARENT THAT THEY; TOO; WERE ATTEMPTING THE SAME APCH WE WERE. I CALLED AND ASKED WHERE THEY WERE AND THEIR TYPE. THEY REPLIED THAT THEY WERE TWO SINGLE ENG TRAINERS ABOUT 5-10 MILES BEHIND US. I DIDN'T LIKE THIS MUCH BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE FOLLOWING THE SAME RTE; DSNDING TO ABOUT OUR ALT AND WOULD HAVE A VERY RAPID OVERTAKE SPEED ON US. WE CONTINUED OUR DSCNT TO A POINT APPROX 25 MILES FROM ZZZ KEEPING AN EYE ON THE LOWERING WX CONDITIONS AND ANOTHER EYE TO THE REAR WATCHING FOR THE FOLLOWING JETS. NOT AT ALL A COMFORTABLE SIT IN MOUNTAINOUS CONDITIONS. OUR FLT ACTUALLY WENT FURTHER W AND A LOT LOWER THAN WAS COMFORTABLE; BUT WITH THE JETS CLOSING AND STILL UNSEEN IT WAS TIME TO DO THE STANDARD 180 DEG TURN. WE PROBABLY PRESSED THE LIMITS OF 500 FT ABOVE THE UNPOPULATED TERRAIN AT THIS TURN AROUND POINT TO RETURN TO THE E WHERE THE WX CONTINUED TO BE EXCELLENT. PRIOR TO MAKING THE TURN I CALLED THE TRAINERS AND TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET UNDER THE CLOUDS TO CONTINUE TO THE ARPT AND THAT WE WERE TURNING AROUND AND THAT THEY SHOULD DO THE SAME. THEY ACKNOWLEDGED; DID THEIR 180 DEG TURN AND THEN HEADED TO ZZZ1 ARPT. WE NEVER DID SEE THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE PROBABLY A LOT CLOSER THAN WE WOULD HAVE LIKED; ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR OVERTAKE SPD. WE TOO; HEADED TO ZZZ1 WHERE THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A GENERALLY CLEAR AREA OVER THE ARPT. THE TRAINERS FOUND IT AND GOT UNDER THE CLOUDS AND PROCEEDED ON TO ZZZ. WE WERE NOT SO FORTUNATE. THE HOLE CLOSED AND WE COULDN'T GET TO ZZZ1 ARPT SO WE DIVERTED BACK TO ZZZ2 FOR THE RON. UPON SHUTDOWN AT ZZZ2; I DISCOVERED THAT I HAD NOT RESET MY XPONDER FROM AN ASSIGNED CODE PROVIDED BY APCH THE DAY BEFORE WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE AIR SHOW; TO THE REQUIRED VFR 1200. OOPS! THAT PROBABLY DID NOT ENDEAR ME AND MY ACFT TO APCH; AND EVENTUALLY CTR ON OUR RETURN FLT. USUALLY THE PROC IS FOR THE NUMBER TWO ACFT IN THE FORMATION TO PLACE HIS XPONDER ON STANDBY; BUT I KNEW THAT WE WOULD BE FLYING A RATHER LOOSE FORMATION SO I DECIDED TO TURN IT ON. BIG MISTAKE! WHEN ONE RARELY USES ANYTHING BUT 1200 I GUESS IT IS ALL TOO EASY TO OVERLOOK RESETTING THE XPONDER. MY NEW REVISED CHKLIST FOR MY ACFT WILL STATE 'XPONDER; ON OR STANDBY; CHECK CODE.' SO WE NOW KNOW THAT THE PROB AROSE FROM CONTINUED FLT INTO WORSENING WX CONDITIONS. WE WERE SOMEWHAT DISTRACTED IN OUR DECISION TO DO THE 180 BY THE FACT THAT A COUPLE OF JETS WERE BREATHING DOWN OUR NECKS. THIS WAS PROBABLY THE MAJOR CAUSE FOR FLYING A LOT LOWER THAN WE WANTED TO BE BEFORE TURNING AROUND TO THE EXCELLENT WX CONDITIONS TO THE E. THE DESIRE TO GET HOME; OFTEN REFERRED TO AS 'GET HOMEITIS' I'M SURE PLAYED A PART; THE WX FORECAST FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS NOT THE BRIGHTEST. THE XPONDER CODE ERROR WAS AN OVERSIGHT THAT WOULD/SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITH A PROPER CHKLIST OR JUST PAYING MORE ATTENTION. APPARENTLY THE URGE TO GET OUT BEFORE WX CONDITIONS DETERIORATED AND NIGHTFALL AT OUR HOME BASE CREATED WAY TOO MUCH COMPLACENCY ON MY PART. WE SHOULD HAVE STAYED OVER AND DEPARTED IN THE MORNING; THAT WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED THE LOW ALT FLT OVER THE INTERSTATE WHILE MAKING THE 180 DEG TURN TO CLB INTO MOREFAVORABLE WX CONDITIONS.

THROUGHOUT THE EVENING; THE WX WAS BAD. THIS INCLUDED SNOW SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT (HVY AT TIMES); ICING CONDITIONS; STRONG WINDS; AND POOR RWY CONDITIONS. WE HAD A REDUCED ARR RATE DUE TO THE WX; AND WERE HOLDING AT OUR ARR FIXES ALL NIGHT. CTR WAS ALWAYS CALLING TRYING TO GET US (OUR 'TMU') TO TAKE MORE AIRPLANES. JUST PRIOR TO THIS 'EVENT;' OUR RVR FOR RWY 24R DROPPED BELOW 2400 FT. BRAKING ON THAT RWY WAS POOR. ALL OTHER RWYS WERE CLOSED AT THE TIME (RWY 24L MIGHT HAVE OPENED AT SOME POINT -- NOT SURE) AND THEN RWY 24R WAS CLOSED). ARR HAD A LOT OF AIRPLANES THAT COULD NOT LAND AND THEY WERE HOLDING AT ALL ALTS IN THEIR AIRSPACE. I WAS WORKING DEPS COMBINED. JUST PRIOR TO THE EVENT; ARR COORDINATOR APPROVED 2 OVERFLTS AT 5000 FT (W OF THE ARPT) FLYING N-S. THIS WAS A VERY UNUSUAL SIT BECAUSE 1) OVERFLTS ARE NORMALLY (PER LOA) AT 6000 FT; 7000 FT; 11000 FT OR 12000 FT; AND 2) OUR INITIAL ALT TO CLE DEPS IS 5000 FT. THE FIRST OVERFLT WENT THROUGH WITHOUT INCIDENT. RIGHT AFTER THE SECOND ONE ENTERED MY AIRSPACE; I HAD BACK-TO-BACK GARS FROM THE TWR. TMU TOLD ME TO VECTOR THE FIRST ONE TO KEEP HIM OUT OF ARR'S AIRSPACE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. THE SECOND REQUESTED AN IFR TO ORD ON INITIAL CONTACT WITH ME. AT THIS TIME; I WAS ALSO WATCHING NUMEROUS (4-6) AIRPLANES HOLDING IN MY AIRSPACE AT 7000 FT AND 8000 FT (TALKING TO ARR); WORKING A 6000N FT OVERFLT FLYING S-N JUST W OF CLE AND WORKING DEPS. AS I WAS WORKING ON THE ACFT REQUESTING TO DIVERT TO ORD; AN E145 DEPARTED CLE ON A 280 DEG HDG. I 'RADAR IDENTED' HIM BUT COULD NOT CLB HIM DUE TO THE 6000 FT OVERFLT. I DIDN'T GIVE IT A SECOND THOUGHT BECAUSE 5000 FT IS ALWAYS SAFE (EXCEPT FOR TODAY) AND I WENT BACK TO THE OTHER TASKS AT HAND; FORGETTING ABOUT MY 5000 FT OVERFLT. I HAD A LOT OF TAGS ON THE SCOPE OVERLAPPING AND JUST DID NOT CATCH IT. THE CONFLICT ALERT WENT OFF WHEN THE E145 WAS ABOUT 10-15 MI W OF CLE. AT THE SAME TIME; TMU YELLED; 'DO YOU HAVE THOSE 2 AT 5?' I INSTRUCTED THE E145 (TWICE) TO 'TURN L HDG 180 DEGS IMMEDIATELY FOR TFC' AND THEN TRUSTED THE OVERFLT TO TURN R HDG 270 DEGS IMMEDIATELY FOR TFC. BOTH ACFT COMPLIED AND NEITHER PLT SAID ANYTHING. BOTH ACFT WERE TURNED BACK ON COURSE PRETTY QUICKLY AND I CONTINUED TO WORK MY OTHER TFC. ABOUT 45 MINS LATER; I WENT ON BREAK. BEFORE GOING BACK ON POSITION; I ADVISED THE SUPVR THAT I HAD TWO GET A LITTLE CLOSE BUT I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW CLOSE THEY GOT. ANOTHER CTLR THOUGHT I HAD 3 MI OR DIVERGING COURSES AT ALL TIMES. I THOUGHT I HAD LESS. I WAS TOLD NOT TO WORRY UNLESS WE GOT A PHONE CALL (WHICH NEVER CAME). IN HINDSIGHT; PRIMARY CAUSE: I FORGOT ABOUT MY OVERFLT. SECONDARY CAUSES: 1) TMU TOOK TOO MANY AIRPLANES. 2) DEP SHOULD'VE BEEN SPLIT. 3) OVERLAPPING TAGS. 4) OVERFLTS SHOULD NEVER BE APPROVED AT 5000 FT.",,,,"CLE TRACON CTLR EXPERIENCED OPERROR AT 5000 FT WITH DEP AND OVERFLT TFC DURING BUSY AND COMPLEX TFC PERIOD.",

TODAY I BEGAN THE LAST DAY OF A 4-DAY PAIRING AND 8TH DAY OF THE LAST 9. MY BRIEF BEGAN WITH 'LET'S NOT GET IN A HURRY' BECAUSE OUR PLANE HAD ARRIVED 30 MINS LATE. I WAS PAIRED WITH A NEW FO (3 MONTHS) WHO WAS DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB FOR HIS SHORT TENURE. ACCORDING TO THE ATIS IN ISP; PLANES WERE LNDG ON RWY 24 AND DEPARTING RWY 33L. ALL COCKPIT CHKS WERE NORMAL AND I CALLED FOR THE BEFORE PUSH CHKLIST AND WAS HANDED THE OPC. I GLANCED AT THE ATIS SHEET ON THE PANEL ONE LAST TIME AND VIEWED THE LNDG AND DEPARTING RWY 33L NOTE. THE DATA ON THE OPC WAS HIGHLIGHTED FOR RWY 24 AND PERFORMANCE NUMBERS WERE BRIEFED FOR RWY 24. THE STOPPING MARGIN WAS NOTED AND WRITTEN DOWN. AFTER PUSHBACK; I OBSERVED A COMPANY JET TAXIING IN FOR THE GATE WE HAD JUST DEPARTED. AFTER START CHKS WERE COMPLETED; AND THE FO CALLED FOR TAXI. GND CTL ASKED US IF WE COULD SIDESTEP AND ALLOW COMPANY ROOM TO GET BY AND TO TAXI TO RWY 33L. WE DID AS REQUESTED. AFTER THE SIDESTEP MANEUVER; WE WERE PRETTY MUCH LINED UP AT THE HOLD SHORT LINE OF RWY 33L; AS IT WAS AN EXTREMELY SHORT TAXI AND HAD TO ROLL ONLY A FEW YARDS. THE BEFORE TKOF CHKLIST WAS COMPLETED AND WE WERE GIVEN TKOF CLRNC FOR RWY 33L. TRYING TO BE A GOOD MENTOR FOR THE NEW FO; I STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF USING ALL THE AVAILABLE RWY AND INFORMED HIM I WOULD USE A MODIFIED STATIC TKOF ROLL. WE BACK-TAXIED INTO POS. MY MISTAKE OF USING TKOF DATA FOR RWY 24 ON RWY 33L HAD STILL NOT BEEN REALIZED. AS I REFLECT ON THESE EVENTS AND READ MY WORDS; MY NOT CATCHING THIS ERROR IS EXTREMELY DISCONCERTING. I DEPARTED WITHOUT INCIDENT OR IRREGULARITY. ALTHOUGH THE TKOF ROLL APPEARED TO BE NORMAL AS COMPARED TO OTHER SYS WIDE SHORT FIELD DEPS; A FEELING OF SOMETHING IN ERROR CAME OVER ME WHILE CLBING THROUGH 10000 FT. I HANDED THE ACFT TO THE FO AND REVIEWED THE LOAD SHEET; AND FOUND NOTHING OUT OF ORDER. I REACHED FOR THE OPC TO REVIEW THE TKOF DATA AND IT HIT ME. I HAD USED RWY 24 DATA FOR RWY 33L AND HAD DEPARTED OVER ATOG AND HAD NOT CAUGHT IT. HAD RWY 33L BEEN SELECTED; PERFORMANCE NUMBERS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE. I HAD TAKEN OFF ON AN UNBALANCED RWY AND WAS DEVASTATED. I IMMEDIATELY CHKED TO SEE HOW MANY CHILDREN HAD BOARDED AND THERE WERE ONLY 10. THE CHILD WT FACTORED IN STILL DID NOT COVER MY ERROR. SOMEHOW I HAD OVERLOOKED THE RWY BOX ON THE TKOF PERFORMANCE PAGE. THERE WERE PROBABLY SEVERAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS INVOLVED; BUT NONE STAND OUT AS BEING A MAIN CAUSE. I UNDERSTAND THE SEVERITY OF MY OMISSION AND AS CAPT I ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY. I HONESTLY THOUGHT I WAS USING THE CORRECT PERFORMANCE NUMBERS. IN THE FUTURE; I WILL TAKE MORE TIME IN REVIEWING THE OPC TKOF PAGE AND THEN ASK FOR THE BEFORE PUSH CHKLIST. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY PRACTICE TO WRITE DOWN AND CIRCLE ON THE RELEASE THE AVAILABLE STOPPING MARGIN. I THINK NOW I WILL INCLUDE THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF THE RWY (IE; RWY 24; 1310 FT).

I HAD RECEIVED A HDOF FROM ZJX 10 MI N OF PIE ON AN ACR X FLT SWBOUND AND XING PIE AT FL270. I ENTERED AN INTERIM ALT OF FL240 IN THE DATA BLOCK AND FLASHED THE ACFT TO SECTOR 07; RSW ARRS SECTOR. I WAS WORKING THE SECTOR ALONE. I HAD 2 BAYS OF STRIPS AND A NATL EVALUATOR (MR X) PLUGGED IN AND BEHIND ME; AND OBSERVING MY SECTOR. I POSITIONED 1/2 WAY BTWN THE RADAR POS AND THE RADAR ASSISTANT POS TRYING TO MANAGE THE FLT PROGRESS STRIPS. I GLANCED BACK AT THE RADAR DISPLAY KNOWING ACR X WOULD BE AT PIE AND I COULD DSND THE ACFT; BUT INSTEAD I HAD ANOTHER DATA BLOCK WITH ACR X NOW (THE DATA BLOCKS WERE OVERLAPPING). IT WAS AN ACR Y FLT VERY CLOSE TO MY BOUNDARY AND FLASHING AT ME AT FL250. I QUICKLY TOOK THIS LATE HDOF; BUT I DO NOT THINK I REALIZED THAT THE ACFT WAS APCHING PIE SEBOUND AND HAD THE JETSTREAM; 100+ MPH FROM THE W; PUSHING HIM WITH A 120 MPH OVERTAKE ON THE ACR X AT FL270. I WAS TALKING TO THE EVALUATOR; WORKING OTHER TFC; APPROX 10 OTHER ACFT ON MY DISPLAY; MANAGING THE STRIPS; 2 BAYS OF THEM AND MORE ON THE PRINTER; WHEN I ISSUED A DSCNT CLRNC TO ACR X TO FL240 AND XFERRED COMS TO R07. A SHORT TIME LATER; I NOTICED THE CONFLICT ALERT (THE DATA BLOCKS FLASHING) BTWN ACR X APPROX HDG 190 DEGS AT FL255; AND ACR Y APPROX HDG 160 DEGS AT FL250. THE 2 ACFT WERE 3 MI APART AND DIVERGING. I ISSUED ACR Y A HDG OF 140 DEGS TO INCREASE THEIR DIVERGENCE; THE PLT ADVISED THE TFC WAS IN SIGHT AND SEPARATION WAS RE-ESTABLISHED. WORKING AT A BUSY SECTOR ALONE WITH THE ADDED PRESSURE OF AN EVALUATOR OBSERVING OPS AND RECEIVING A LATE HDOF FROM ZJX WITH A HUGE OVERTAKE NOT ASSESSED DUE TO DISTRS FROM OTHER REQUIRED DUTIES. THE EVALUATOR HAD ONLY BEEN THERE FOR A FEW MINS AND WHEN HE FIRST PLUGGED IN MY HEADSET WOULD NOT XMIT. AFTER A FAILED XMISSION; I HAD TO QUICKLY CHANGE HEADSET JACKS AND VERIFY MY EQUIP WAS OK. I ALSO WAS IN THE PROCESS OF CHANGING MY MAP AT THE SECTOR SO I COULD SHOW THE EVALUATOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA AND WHAT AIRSPACE I WAS WORKING. THE STRIPS AT THIS SECTOR ARE OUT OF CTL AND UNMANAGEABLE. WE DO NOT USE URET (AUTOMATED STRIPS); BUT ZJX DOES SO WE GET EVEN MORE STRIPS THAN USUAL; INCREASING THE WORKLOAD AT THIS SECTOR. I BELIEVE ALL THESE THINGS DIVERTED MY ATTN FROM THE RADAR SCOPE -- A DANGEROUS MOVE ON MY PART! WHAT CAN BE DONE: 1) THE RADAR CTLR SHOULD NOT HAVE TO MANAGE FLT PROGRESS STRIPS AND DIVERT HIS ATTN FROM THE RADAR DISPLAY. THIS SECTOR HAD 2 FULL BAYS OF STRIPS AND EVEN MORE PRINTING; AND ON THE PRINTER. 2) WHEN A NATL EVALUATOR MONITORS A SECTOR; A SUPVR SHOULD ALSO PLUG IN TO ASSIST BY EXPLAINING SECTOR OP; NUANCES AND PROCS -- NOT THE RADAR CTLR. 3) URET (AUTOMATED STRIPS) MIAMI URET TRAINING HAS NOT BEEN SCHEDULED DESPITE THE INSTALLATION OF THE EQUIP AND SOFTWARE AT THE FACILITY. I BELIEVE ZMA IS THE ONLY NON-URET CTR IN THE COUNTRY! OUR PAPER STRIPS ARE INEFFICIENT AND COSTLY. 4) STAFFING NEEDS TO IMPROVE. HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATION: WITH 25+ YRS (21 OF THOSE WITH THE FAA) OF ATC EXPERIENCE; IT IS EASY TO TRUST YOUR OWN JUDGEMENTS. I HAD PERCEIVED THE ACR X AND ACR Y WERE SIMILAR TYPE ACFT AND PERFORMANCE. THE JETSTREAM RARELY VISITS US THIS FAR S AND USUALLY ONLY AFFECTS OUR SEQUENCING OF EBOUND TFC. I HAD SEEN THIS SIT MANY TIMES; BUT THAT PERCEPTION WAS WRONG. THESE ACFT WERE TRACKING IN SUCH A WAY THAT ONE WAS SLOWED BY THE EXTREME WINDS OF THE JETSTREAM AND THE OTHER WAS SPED UP BY IT; EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE ON VERY SIMILAR RTES AFTER PIE. ONCE I WAS AWARE OF THE CONFLICT; WHICH WAS TOO LATE; I QUICKLY DETERMINED THE ACFT WERE BECOMING MORE SEPARATED BY DIVERGENCE. ANOTHER FACTOR AFFECTING THE QUALITY ON MY HUMAN PERFORMANCE WAS THE NATL EVALUATOR BEING PRESENT. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NOT AN OVERWHELMING PHYSICAL DISTR; NATL EVALUATIONS ARE A BIG DEAL AT A FACILITY AND EMPLOYEES ARE EXPECTED TO PERFORM THEIR BEST. THAT WAS ONE REASON I DIVERTED MY ATTN TO THE STRIPS; TO ENSURE THERE WERE NO DUPLICATES OR DEADWOOD THE EVALUATOR WOULD SEE. I AM POSITIVE IF THE EVALUATOR WERE NOT THERE; I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE FOCUSED ON THE RADAR INSTEAD OF THE 'WHOLE' SECTOR.",,,,"ZMA CTLR EXPERIENCED OPERROR AT FL250 DISTR BY AN EVALUATOR'S PRESENCE AND STRIP DATA BLOCK MGMNT.",

I HAVE RE-READ MY GARMIN MANUAL AND CANNOT FIND ANY INFO ABOUT WHY ONE UNIT WOULD SHOW THE AIRSPACE ON THE MAP WHEN THE OTHER UNIT DID NOT DISPLAY IT.

WE WERE TURNED TO BASE CLOSE IN TO THE FIELD; BUT N OF THE FAF. THE AUTOPLT WAS ON. I NOTICED COMPANY TFC ABOVE AND IN FRONT OF US AS WE ROLLED OUT ONTO THE BASE LEG. BECAUSE OF OUR CLOSE PROX TO HIM; IT APPEARED TO ME THAT HE WAS LNDG ON RWY 18R; THOUGH I KNEW THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. ATC POINTED HIM OUT TO US AND STATED THAT THE COMPANY TFC WAS LNDG RWY 18L AND THEN CLRED US FOR THE VISUAL. AS I WAS PROCESSING THIS INFO; OUR HIGH CLOSURE RATE WITH THE OTHER ACFT CONTINUED TO REDUCE THE SEPARATION BTWN US. I MADE A COMMENT ABOUT IT TO THE FO.

I REALIZED OUR HIGH AIRSPD WAS RESULTING IN A LARGE TURN RADIUS THAT RESULTED IN A GROSS OVERSHOOT TO FINAL. THE FO DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT AND INCREASED THE BANK ANGLE TOWARD THE EXTENDED CTRLINE. THE COMBINATION OF HIGH INDICATED AIRSPD AND BANK ANGLE BRIEFLY TRIGGERED THE 'BANK ANGLE' AURAL. THE ACFT WAS STABILIZED AND CONFIGURED FOR A NORMAL LNDG.

WE STARTED OFF THE DAY WITH A HUGE DEFICIT IN SLEEP. SIMPLY BEING ON THE GND FOR 8 HRS DOES NOT PROVIDE TIME FOR QUALITY REST. THE RESULT IS AN EXHAUSTED CREW THE NEXT DAY.

THE INITIAL DEP PROC STATED THAT WE WERE TO MAINTAIN 1500 FT MSL UNTIL CROSSING THE 4.5 DME OF TEB VOR. DUE TO THE AUTOTHROTTLE PROB; COMPOUNDED BY ATC FREQ CHANGE INSTRUCTION SHORTLY AFTER LIFTOFF; AND VERY LIGHT WT; WE EXCEEDED THE 1500 FT MSL RESTR AND DID NOT LEVEL OFF UNTIL 1900 FT MSL WHERE WE STARTED TO DSND BACK TO THE PROPER ALT; AND SIMULTANEOUSLY; DEP CTL ADVISED US OF OUR ALT. THE PF HAD THE ALT SELECT SET AT 2000 FT (THE FINAL CLRED ALT ON THE DEP PROC) INSTEAD OF THE LOWER 1500 FT WHICH MAY HAVE ADDED TO THE SIT. ALTHOUGH AT THE TIME OF PREFLT BRIEFING; BOTH PLTS WERE AWARE OF THE 1500 FT RESTR. THE PNF; WITH HEADS DOWN TO CHANGE FREQ; DID NOT CATCH THIS ALT DEVIATION UNTIL PASSING THE 1500 FT. ESTIMATED TOTAL TIME FROM LIFT-OFF TO LEVEL OFF AT 1900 FT WAS APPROX 35 SEC DUE TO HIGH PERFORMANCE. THE SHORT TIME TO LEVEL OFF; I AM SURE ADDED TO THE PROB. NO OTHER ACFT WERE INVOLVED. ACFT RETURNED TO 1500 FT AND NO FURTHER PROBS WERE ENCOUNTERED. I BELIEVE THAT LOW LEVEL-OFF ALTS; ESPECIALLY IN HIGHLY CONGESTED AREAS; ARE A POTENTIAL PROB. I REALIZE THAT IN MANY CASES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO USE MORE REALISTIC ALT RESTRS; HOWEVER; FACTORS SUCH AS ACFT PERFORMANCE; TIME TO CHANGE ATC FREQS; TURNS ETC IN ADDITION TO THE OCCASIONAL OPERATIONAL PROB; SHOULD MORE REALISTICALLY BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN DESIGNING DEP PROCS OR GIVING RESTRS BEFORE DEP.",,,,"A G4 DEPARTING ON TEB 5 (TEB) EXCEEDED THE INITIAL 1500 FT ALT BUT DSNDED DOWN WHILE TROUBLESHOOTING AN AUTOTHROTTLE PROB.",

I INSPECTED THE LOGBOOK AND NOTICED 4 MEL'S. THE FIRST MEL WAS NON FUNCTIONING AUTOTHROTTLES. THE SECOND MEL WAS THE AUTOPRESSURIZATION; MEANING YOU MUST USE THE STANDBY FUNCTION. THE LAST 2 MEL'S DEALT WITH MINOR CABIN LIGHTING. THE WRITE-UP ON THE PRESSURIZATION WAS FROM THE DAY BEFORE. THE CREW WAS CRUISING AT FL270 WHEN THE CABIN STARTED TO CLB. THEY WERE UNABLE TO CTL THE CABIN WITH EITHER STANDBY OR MANUAL CTL. THEY ELECTED TO DO AN EMER DSCNT AND WERE ABLE TO REGAIN CTL AT 14000 FT MSL WITH THE STANDBY SYS. THE WRITE-UP DIDN'T SAY IF THE CABIN REACHED THAT ALT; BUT SINCE THERE WASN'T A WRITE-UP ABOUT THE CABIN MASKS; I'LL ASSUME THAT IT DIDN'T. MY FO WAS NEW ON THE AIRPLANE; HAVING COME FROM THE AIRBUS MOT RECENTLY. HE ONLY HAD 2 MONTHS EXPERIENCE. AFTER ENG START; WE DID THE SUPPLEMENTAL PROC REQUIRED BY THE MEL TO CHK FOR CTLABILITY OF THE OUTFLOW VALVE WITH THE MANUAL SYS; BOTH AC AND DC. I THEN NOTICED HE HAD SET THE PANEL UP INCORRECTLY FOR STANDBY OP; SO I INSTRUCTED HIM IN THE CORRECT PROC. WE FINISHED THE AFTER START CHKLIST THEN PROCEEDED TO THE TKOF RWY WHICH WAS A VERY SHORT TAXI OF LESS THAN 3 MINS. WE DID THE BEFORE TKOF CHKLIST DURING TAXI AND DEPARTED. THE FO WAS THE PF AND I WAS THE PLT MONITORING. JUST AFTER TKOF; I NOTICED THE CABIN WAS CLBING AT AN EXCESSIVE RATE. I DID THE AFTER TKOF CHKLIST THEN PROCEEDED TO TROUBLESHOOT THE CABIN PROB. ON COLD MORNINGS AND THE AIRPLANE BEING LIGHT; IT WAS CLBING AT OVER 4000 FPM. WE WERE REQUIRED TO USE FULL PWR DUE TO THE AUTOTHROTTLES BEING INOP. IN MY MIND WAS THE SAME SCENARIO FROM THE PREVIOUS DAY. I TRIED MANUAL MODE TO TRY TO GAIN CTL OF THE CABIN. I WAS SHOWING ABOUT 1 1/2 PSI DIFFERENTIAL DURING THE CLB. WE LEVELED OFF AT 11000 FT MSL WITH ZBW. I TOLD ZBW THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO RETURN TO BDL FOR MAINT AS WE HAD A PRESSURIZATION PROB. WE WERE STARTING TO GET VECTORS; WHEN I NOTICED WE HAD BOTH AC PACKS OFF. I TURNED THE PACKS ON AND WAS ABLE TO GAIN CTL OF THE CABIN. LESSON LEARNED: JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE HIGH EXPERIENCE IN THE COCKPIT DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE SAFER. WITH THE FO BEING NEW TO THE EQUIP; I SHOULD HAVE MONITORED THE CHKLIST MORE CLOSELY. WE SHOULD HAVE TALKED MORE AT THE GATE ABOUT STANDBY OP. I SHOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY LEVELED OFF AT THE FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE. IF THE AUTOTHROTTLES HAD BEEN WORKING; WE WOULD HAVE USED DE-RATED PWR FOR TKOF AND CLB ALLOWING A SLOWER RATE OF CLB.

I ADVISED THE COMPANY OF THE SIZE OF THE ANIMAL AND THE WT OF WELL OVER 100 LBS. I ALSO ADVISED THEM THAT THE BODY HARNESSES THAT WE KEEP ABOARD THE ACFT FOR SUCH OCCURRENCES WOULD NOT BE BIG ENOUGH TO FIT THE ANIMAL AND ARE ONLY RATED FOR 35-50 LBS. THE FIRST ASSISTANT CHIEF PLT I SPOKE WITH AGREED WITH ME IN MY ASSUMPTION THAT WE COULD NOT TAKE THE ANIMAL ON THE CHARTER WITHOUT VIOLATING CHARTER COMPANY'S FOM REGARDING THE CARRIAGE OF ANIMALS AND CARGO. WE ALSO AGREED THAT WE COULD NOT BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH FAR SECTION 135.87 CARRIAGE OF CARGO. WHEN THE CUSTOMER ARRIVED AND WAS TOLD HE COULD NOT TAKE THE ANIMAL; HE WAS VERY UPSET AND ASKED TO SPEAK WITH MY MGR. AFTER BEING TOLD TO PUT THE ANIMAL IN THE POTTY AREA WITH THE DOOR CLOSED HE GOT EVEN MORE UPSET AND REFUSED TO EVEN THINK OF SUCH AN OPTION. THE PROB WAS ESCALATED TO CHARTER COMPANY'S ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF OPS; WHO INFORMED ME THAT I WAS TO TAKE THE DOG! STRONGLY COERCING ME; I MADE HIM FAX ME A LETTER STATING THAT THE OWNER'S SUPPLIED LEASH AND COLLAR (WITH UNKNOWN WT RATINGS) WAS LEGAL ACCORDING THE CHARTER COMPANY'S FOM AND FARS TO TRANSPORT THE ANIMAL. EVEN THOUGH CURRENTLY THE CHARTER COMPANY'S FOM STATES SOMETHING CONTRARY. AFTER RECEIVING THIS LETTER; I LOADED THE ANIMAL IN WHAT MAY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN CONTRARY TO FARS. THE ANIMAL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SECURED ENOUGH THROUGH ITS LEASH TO PREVENT IT FROM MOVING ON ITS OWN. WITH THE SIZE OF THE ANIMAL; IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE ANIMAL FROM BLOCKING AT LEAST 1 EMER EXIT OF THE ACFT AT ANY GIVEN TIME. THE LEASH AND COLLAR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN STRONG ENOUGH TO CONTAIN THE ANIMAL IN AN ACCIDENT OR ABORTED TKOF SIT. IT MAY HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL FOR THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF OPS TO REWRITE THE FAA APPROVED FOM WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF CHARTER COMPANY POI. BY ACCEPTING THIS LETTER AS APPROVAL; I MAY HAVE ACTED CONTRARY TO FARS. I REGRET THAT I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BEND TO THE SEVERE PRESSURE THAT CHARTER COMPANY ASSISTANT POI PLACED ON ME TO CARRY SUCH A LARGE ANIMAL ON AN ACFT THAT CLRLY IS NOT DESIGNED FOR SUCH A THING.

THE FLT ATTENDANT TOLD THE CAPT THE NOISE WAS FIRST OBSERVED AFTER TKOF AND THE PAX WERE CONCERNED AND WORRIED AND WANT TO TALK TO THE PLTS TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG. THE CAPT CONSULTED MAINT. MAINT HAD A COUPLE OF IDEAS OF WHAT THE PROB (NOT SAFETY CONCERN) MIGHT BE AND INITIALLY WE CONSIDERED CONTINUING TO MKE. THE ACFT HAD NO AERODYNAMIC PROBS; ENG PROBS; ETC.

WE KNEW THAT WE HAD A MAINT ISSUE THAT WAS NOT AFFECTING THE SAFETY OF THE FLT AS DETERMINED BY THE NORMAL FUNCTIONING OF THE ACFT; BUT A RETURN TO CVG TO HAVE THE ACFT LOOKED AT WOULD BE PRUDENT. A FEW MINS AFTER TURNING BACK TO CVG; THE NOISE STOPPED. WE LANDED AT CVG; AN EMER WAS NOT DECLARED; BECAUSE THE ACFT WAS ACTING NORMALLY. WE EXTENDED THE GEAR EARLY; BECAUSE THE FLT ATTENDANTS INITIALLY SAID THEY HEARD THE NOISE AFTER GEAR RETRACTION. THE GEAR EXTENDED NORMALLY -- NO UNUSUAL NOISES WERE HEARD. THE ACFT LANDED NORMALLY AND TAXIED TO THE GATE. UPON INSPECTION; THE FUEL DOOR WAS OBSERVED OPEN; AND THE FUEL CAP WAS MISSING. IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE FUEL CAP SEPARATED FROM THE ACFT AFTER TURNING BACK TO CVG. IT IS NORMALLY SCREWED ONTO THE FUEL PORT AFTER REFUELING. IF NOT; IT IS HANGING FREELY BY APPROX AN 8-INCH CHAIN. I ASSUME THAT THE NOISE HEARD BY THE PAX WAS THE CAP BANGING AGAINST WING. THE WING WAS SCRATCHED WHERE THE CAP HIT THE WING. THE FUEL DOOR REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE ACFT AND UNDAMAGED. THE CAPT AND MYSELF HAD CONSIDERED AN OUTSIDE ACCESS DOOR MAY BE OPEN; INCLUDING THE FUEL DOOR; BUT WE REALLY DID NOT KNOW FOR SURE. NORMALLY; THE FUELER IS RESPONSIBLE TO CLOSE THE DOOR AND SCREW THE CAP ON. ALSO; THE TUG DRIVER ON PUSHBACK ALONG WITH WING WALKERS IS TO VERIFY ALL OUTSIDE ACCESS DOORS CLOSED. I DON'T KNOW IF THE DOOR WAS CLOSED OR NOT ON PUSHBACK. THE FUELER WAS STILL FUELING THE ACFT AFTER I COMPLETED THE WALKAROUND AND HAD POSITIONED MYSELF ON THE FLT DECK TO PERFORM OTHER DUTIES. MY MAINT CONCERN IS FOR BEING SCRUTINIZED FOR NOT DECLARING AN EMER. FROM THE CAPT'S JUDGEMENT AND MYSELF; IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY. THE ACFT OPERATED NORMALLY; ALL INDICATIONS WERE NORMAL; THE NOISE WENT AWAY; THE GEAR EXTENDED NORMALLY. I CONCURRED THAT WE HAD A MINOR MECHANICAL ISSUE THAT NEEDED TO BE SORTED OUT IN CVG. ALSO; THE PAX WERE NOT HAPPY; AND I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE UPSET IF WE CONTINUED 50 MINUTES TO MKE RATHER THAN RETURNING THE 10 MINS TO CVG.

BECAUSE IT IS THE NATURE OF MY DAILY FLT MISSIONS TO OPERATE ACFT IN VARYING STATES OF REPAIR; I DID NOT ANTICIPATE THE KIND OF PROBS THAT THIS ACFT PRESENTED ME WITH.

AFTER A ROUTINE PREFLT AND RUNUP; A NORMAL TKOF WAS COMPLETED. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE TKOF; THE 'NORMAL' TRIM FOR THE PITCH SYS FAILED. THE DEP PROC CALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE TURN (WITHIN 1 NM FROM 360 DEGS TO 030 DEGS; WITH THE INITIAL ALT OF 3000 FT -- APPROX 1600 FT CLB). WHILE COMPLETING THE TKOF GEAR; FLAPS; AND ASSOCIATED TKOF TASKS; THE PITCH FLT CTL PRESSURES IN THIS ACFT GROW RAPIDLY. THESE ARE EASILY COMPENSATED FOR WITH THE NORMAL SYS. IN MY CASE; IT WAS NECESSARY TO MOVE A SWITCH AND MOVE 2 TOGGLE SWITCHES LOCATED ON THE CTR PEDESTAL. DURING THE PROCESS OF ACCOMPLISHING THESE TASKS; THE ACFT EXCEEDED THE ASSIGNED ALT OF 3000 FT BY ALMOST 800 FT. I RECOVERED THE RAPIDLY CLBING ACFT AND DSNDED BACK TO 3000 FT. ALL OF THIS TOOK PLACE IN APPROX 2-3 MINS FOLLOWING THE BRAKE RELEASE AT TKOF. LESSONS LEARNED: CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL MAINT RECORDS -- EVEN WHEN THE FLT SEEMS ROUTINE. IF THERE HAS BEEN MAINT ACCOMPLISHED PRIOR TO THE FLT; CONSIDER THE WX; ATC; AND ANY OTHER LIMITING FACTORS -- IN MY CASE; I WAS RECOVERING FROM A COLD.

I WAS NOT PRESENT; AS DISCREPANCY OCCURRED ON MY DAY OFF; BUT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE; THE INDICATOR WAS REPLACED FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION. THIS WORK CARD IS ACCOMPLISHED AFTER THE GLOBAL FMS MODIFICATION IN ORDER TO DO AN OPS CHK OF ALL THE UNITS DISTURBED DURING THE WIRING INSTALLATION OF THE GLOBAL FMS. SINCE THE GENERATOR CTL UNITS WERE REMOVED AND REINSTALLED; AN OPS CHK WAS REQUIRED AND AT ZZZ IS USUALLY ACCOMPLISHED BY AN AVIONICS TECHNICIAN ASSISTING THE A&P MECHS WHO ARE ENG RUN QUALIFIED. THIS WAS THE CASE BECAUSE AS AN AVIONICS AMT I AM NOT ENG RUN QUALIFIED. I PERFORMED THE TESTS ON THE #1 AND #2 ENG GENERATORS PER STEPS 44 AND 45 OF ENGINEERING CHANGE ORDER XXX CARD 30 AND AMM 24-20-01 AND FOUND BOTH SYS TO CHK NORMAL. SINCE THE ONLY PLACE TO SIGN OFF FOR THE WORK I PERFORMED WAS ON STEPS 44 AND 45 OF THE WORK CARD; I DID SO. PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE A&P MECH RUNNING THE ENGS TO SIGN ON THE LINES WITH ME. AS POINTED OUT TO ME BY FAA REPRESENTATIVE; WHEN I SIGNED OFF THESE 2 STEPS; I WAS ALSO SIGNING FOR ALL THE ENG CHKS; WHICH COULD HAVE INCLUDED THE THRUST RATING INDICATOR. PLEASE ALLOW ME TO POINT OUT THAT THE NOMENCLATURE IN STEPS 44 AND 45 DO NOT CALL OUT FOR ENG 'CHKS' OR 'TESTS' BUT MERELY ENG RUN FOR THE OBVIOUS REASON THAT THE ENG MUST BE RUNNING IN ORDER FOR THE GENERATOR SYS TO FUNCTION. ALSO ALLOW ME TO POINT OUT THAT THE WORK CARD WAS WRITTEN WITH THE INTENT THAT THE WORK WOULD BE PERFORMED AT LINE STATIONS OTHER THAN ZZZ WHERE THE A&P MECH PERFORMS THE GENERATOR CHKS WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF THE AVIONICS TECHNICIAN AND; THEREFORE; IS OPERATING THE ENG HIMSELF AT THE TIME. PERHAPS; TO CLARIFY THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SIGNOFFS; THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THESE 2 STEPS COULD BE REMOVED AND AN ADDITIONAL STEP ADDED FOR THE A&P TO SIGN OFF FOR ENG OP. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT AN ENG RUN IS NOT REQUIRED BY THE MAINT MANUAL FOR A THRUST RATING INDICATOR INSTALLATION; ONLY PER AMM 34-19-02 STEP 3B; A SELF TEST AND A RETURN TO SVC TEST IS THE ONLY REQUIREMENT. I TAKE MY WORK SERIOUS AND WAS JUST AS ALARMED AS EVERYONE ELSE TO DISCOVER THAT THIS OPS CHK WAS SOMEHOW OVERLOOKED AS WELL AS THE STANDBY COMPASS MISSING; SO I DID SOME FOLLOW-UP WORK AFTER MEETING WITH THE REVIEW TEAM AND WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE MY FINDINGS. FIRST OF ALL; I WISH TO POINT OUT THAT ACFT X AS WELL AS ACFT Y WE ARE PRESENTLY WORKING ON AND 2 OTHER PREVIOUS MODIFICATION LINE ACFT WERE A UNIQUE OP IN THE FACT THAT THEY WERE NOT WORKED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A 'C' CHK OR ANY OTHER OP; WHERE PATTERN CARDS OR ROUTINE CARDS ASSIGNED TO THE 'C' CHK ARE PERFORMED AFTER THE ACFT IS DE-HANGARED. THESE ROUTINE CHK CARDS COVER OPS CHKS ON PRACTICALLY ALL SYS AND WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THESE DISCREPANCIES FROM OCCURRING ON ACFT X. ALSO THE GLOBAL FMS AND ENHANCED GND PROX MODIFICATION ARE GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY ENGINEERING CHANGE ORDER XXXX; WHICH IS THE CAPT'S; FO'S; AND CTR INST PANEL STANDARDIZATION MODIFICATION. IN FACT; REF TO THIS IS MADE IN ENGINEERING CHANGE ORDER YYYY; WHICH STATES IN THE NOTE: COORD WITH ENGINEERING CHANGE ORDER AAAA. SINCE THIS ENGINEERING CHANGE ORDER WAS NOT ACCOMPLISHED AT THIS VISIT; THE ENGINEERING CHANGE ORDER AAAA WAS NOT ISSUED IN THE BILL OF WORK. ALSO NOT ISSUED IN THE BILL OF WORK (TO MY KNOWLEDGE; ANYWAY) WAS CARD 'MAINT PROGRAM QUALITY CHKLIST' WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE ISSUED ON EVERY MD80 MODIFICATION LINE CHK EVEN THOUGH THE DOCK MGR HAS THE DISCRETION TO WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY 'N/A' IT. PERHAPS; IF IT HAD BEEN ISSUED; THE THRUST RATING INDICATOR WOULD HAVE BEEN CHKED. THE STANDBY COMPASS WOULD HAVE BEEN CHKED; AND THE COCKPIT DOOR OP WOULD HAVE BEEN CHKED. ALL THAT ASSUMING THAT THESE STEPS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN N/A'ED BY MGMNT. TO SUMMARIZE THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENTS THAT TOOK PLACE ON ACFT X; I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT THE PAPERWORK SYS THAT WE HAD IN PLACE DURING THAT OP WAS LACKING; ALLOWING THINGS TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED ON THIS CURRENT OP. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE ONLY PLACE TO SIGN OFF FOR WORK ACCOMPLISHED BEING THE GENERATOR CTL PANEL CHKS WAS ON STEPS 44 AND 45 ON THE JOB CARD.

I WAS FAMILIAR WITH MY RTE AND WITH MY DEST. UNTIL A FEW MI FROM MY DEST; I WAS ON TOP OF A SOLID UNDERCAST WITH BLUE SKY ABOVE. ENRTE; FLT WATCH FORECAST LIKELY LIGHT RAIN AT MY DEST. THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME ICE MOVING IN LATER; BUT NO FORECAST OR PIREPS FOR ICE. DSNDING INTO THE CLOUDS AT ABOUT 5000 FT ABOUT 40 MI OUT; WITH DEST WIND 360 DEGS AT 18 KTS; GUSTING TO 26 KTS; SEVEN MI VISIBILITY; WITH FEW CLOUDS AT 800 FT; 1300 FT AND 2600 FT OVERCAST; AND ABOUT 32 DEGS AT MY ALT; I EXPERIENCED NO ICE. I WAS SETTING UP FOR GPS RWY 36 AT MY DEST WHEN ZMP RPTED BELOW 1/4 MI VISIBILITY AND AN INDEFINITE CEILING WITH SNOW; SO I SET UP FOR ILS RWY 28 INSTEAD; THINKING THAT THE SNOW WOULD BE INTERMITTENT AND PROBABLY SHORT-LIVED. AFTER CROSSING THE IAF AND SOME WAYS DOWN THE GS ON MY DSCNT; THERE WAS SUDDENLY A BIG BUMP OF TURB; AND THEN TWR CALLED TO TELL ME THAT THEY WOULD XMIT CONTINUOUS WIND CONDITIONS; WHICH HAD BECOME A DIRECT CROSSWIND FROM 350-010 DEGS AT 30-33 KTS. I CONTINUED ONWARD; CONCENTRATING ON KEEPING MY PLANE ON THE LOC AND GS. I LOOKED UP AND REALIZED THAT MY WINDSHIELD WAS COVERED WITH ICE; AND GLANCED AT MY MIRROR AND LEADING EDGES; AND REALIZED THAT THEY WERE COVERED WITH BUMPY; SPIKY MIXED ICE. I GLANCED AT THE OAT; AND THOUGHT IT SAID BELOW 0 DEGS F; ALTHOUGH THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE. I WAS TRYING TO ANALYZE THAT WHEN I GLANCED AT MY GEM (GRAPHIC ENGINE MONITOR) AND SAW THE CYLINDER #6 EXHAUST GAS TEMP WAS VERY HIGH AND HADN'T COME DOWN WITH THE OTHERS. I CALLED TWR FOR CURRENT CONDITIONS AND TO MY DISMAY THEY RPTED AN UNCHANGED 1/4 MI WITH INDEFINITE CEILING WITH SNOW. AT THIS POINT; WITH THE HIGH EGT AND THE ICE THAT HAD ACCUMULATED; I DECIDED AGAINST A GAR AND COMMITTED TO LNDG. I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE THE CHANCE OF ACCUMULATING MORE ICE; PERHAPS TO THE POINT THAT THE PLANE COULDN'T FLY; ESPECIALLY WITH A POTENTIAL ENGINE PROB. I FLEW TO THE RIGHT OF THE LOC IN HOPES OF SEEING THE RWY OUT MY L WINDOW; AND KEPT MY AIRSPD HIGHER THAN NORMAL DUE TO THE ICING. I BROKE OUT; SEEING A LARGE FIELD -- UNDOUBTEDLY THE ARPT -- WITHIN MY LIMITED VIEW; AND REALIZED THAT WITH THE WHITE SNOW COVERING EVERYTHING; I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PICK OUT THE RWY. I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE OUTLINE OF A TXWY OR RWY; REALIZED THAT IT WAS PROBABLY THE RWY; AND DECIDED TO LAND ON IT. I DON'T KNOW IF MY WINGS STALLED SEVERAL FEET UP OR IF IT WAS WINDSHEAR; BUT I DROPPED ONTO MY R WHEEL PRETTY HARD. I COULDN'T SEE THE TWR OR ANY OTHER BUILDINGS; AND ASSUME THAT I LANDED BELOW MINIMUMS. THE FBO CHKED OUT MY PLANE THAT AFTERNOON. THE LNDG GEAR HAD SUFFERED NO DAMAGE FROM THE HARD LNDG; BUT THEY FOUND THAT ONE OF THE #6 SPARK PLUGS HAD SHORTED OUT; EXPLAINING THE HIGH EGT. ALTHOUGH I WAS; IN A PERVERSE SORT OF WAY; PROUD OF HAVING SUCCESSFULLY LANDED WITHOUT DAMAGE OR INJURY IN BAD CONDITIONS; IN RETROSPECT THE WISER THING WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE DIVERTED OR TO HAVE HELP UPON HEARING THAT CONDITIONS HAD RAPIDLY WORSENED; INSTEAD OF OPINING THAT CONDITIONS WOULD IMPROVE BEFORE I GOT THERE.

THE MAIN GEAR DID NOT RETRACT. I BELIEVE THE MAIN FACTORS LEADING UP TO THIS INCIDENT WERE BEECHCRAFT'S FAILURE TO DESIGN A SYS WHICH DISABLES GEAR RETRACTION WHILE ON THE GND. THE AIR PRESSURE SWITCH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO RETRACT THE GEAR WHILE THE AIRPLANE IS STILL ON THE GND -- A POOR SYS DESIGN; ESPECIALLY SINCE ROTATION SPD IS 71 KTS.

ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO RESOLUTION OR TERMINAL ADVISORIES GIVEN BY THE TCASII BECAUSE BOTH ACFT CROSSED EACH OTHER WITHIN THE CRITERIA SPECIFIED BY RVSM REGS; THINGS COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH DIFFERENT HAD WE NOT BEEN LISTENING CAREFULLY TO THE RADIOS. I THINK IT WAS OUR LEVEL OF AWARENESS; DUE TO BEING UNUSUALLY WELL RESTED AT THE TIME; WHICH PREVENTED THE SIT FROM BECOMING SOMETHING ELSE.

THE FOLLOWING MORNING WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE ACFT; I NOTICED ON PREFLT THAT THE PRIOR CAPT HAD ENTERED THE MEL INCORRECTLY IN THE LOGBOOK; AND IMPROPERLY DONE THE CORRECTIVE MAINT PROC. THE PRIOR CAPT DID NOT IDENT WHICH HALF OF THE AUTOSLAT SYS WAS INOP. HE ALSO DID NOT GO THROUGH THE COMPLETE MAINT PROC AND COLLAR THE DC CIRCUIT BREAKER FOR THE APPROPRIATE SIDE. THIS ALSO MEANS THAT THE MAINT TECHNICIAN HE RECEIVED THE SIGNOFF FROM IN ZZZ CTL DID NOTHING TO DIAGNOSE OR VERIFY THE CORRECT HALF OF THE SYS WITH HIM EITHER. WE WERE ON A DELAY FOR CREW REST; AND I CALLED MAINT CTL VIA ACR NET AND ADVISED THEM OF THE SIT. THEY CALLED A CONTRACT MAINT TECHNICIAN WHO CAME OUT TO SOLVE THE PROB. WHEN THE CONTRACT TECHNICIAN ARRIVED; WE WERE ABOUT 30 MINS PRIOR TO DEP AND 1/2 WAY THROUGH BOARDING. THE CONTRACT TECHNICIAN DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS THERE TO FIX; SO I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD EVER WORKED ON BOEING ACFT BEFORE. HE REPLIED THAT HE HAD WORKED FOR ACR Y AIRLINES FOR 30 YRS. I STILL HAD MY DOUBTS WHEN HE HAD TO GET SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FROM ACR MAINT ON HIS CELL PHONE. HE COMPLETED THE PROC AND TESTED THE SYS. WE OBTAINED OUR FLOW TIME AND PUSHED BACK FOR START AND TAXI. PERFORMING OUR TAXI FLOW AND CHKS; WE NOTED THAT THE AUTOSLAT LIGHT ON THE OVERHEAD PANEL DID NOT EXTINGUISH WHEN THE MASTER CAUTION LIGHT WAS PRESSED INDICATING THAT BOTH CHANNELS OF THE AUTOSLAT SYS WERE INOP. WE STOPPED ON THE TXWY AND CONTACTED MAINT CTL AGAIN. WE WENT THROUGH THE PROC WITH HIM AND FOUND THAT THE CONTRACT TECHNICIAN HAD COLLARED THE AUTOSLAT #2 DC CIRCUIT BREAKER BY MISTAKE. WE IDENTED THE #1 DC CIRCUIT BREAKERS AS THE INOP CHANNEL AND COLLARED INSTEAD AND CLRED THIS WITH MAINT. CONCLUSIONS: 1) THE PREVIOUS CAPT OF FLT SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN UP THE PROB AND NOTIFIED ACR MAINT PERIOD. HE HAD NO BUSINESS TRYING TO HAPHAZARDLY RUN THROUGH A PROC LIKE THAT AND RACE TO THE HOTEL VAN. HE UNNECESSARILY DELAYED AND JEOPARDIZED OUR OP THE NEXT DAY. MAINT WOULD HAVE HAD ALL NIGHT TO CORRECTLY DIAGNOSE THE PROB; WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE THEIR JOB. 2) THE MAINT TECHNICIAN THE PRIOR CAPT RECEIVED THE SIGNOFF FROM DID NOT PROPERLY GO THROUGH THE PROC WITH THE CAPT. IT GIVES A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN MAINT CTL IF YOU ARE NOT SURE YOU ARE EVEN TALKING WITH A REAL MECH OR JUST SOMEONE WHO READS A FEW LINES FROM AN MEL BOOK AND PARROTS BACK THAT YOU CAN PASTE A COLORED STICKER OVER THE INDICATOR!

HE LOOKED BEWILDERED AND THE PFD INDICATED THE LOW SPD AND AN INDICATED AIRSPD APPROX 5 KTS ABOVE STALL. I IMMEDIATELY SET MAX THRUST AND SIMULTANEOUSLY INSTRUCTED THE FO TO PUSH THE NOSE OVER. STILL STANDING; MY OBSERVANCE WAS THE PITCH ATTITUDE REDUCTION. INDICATED AIRSPD INCREASE AND RATE OF DSCNT WERE NOT PROGRESSING AS I DESIRED AND I ISSUED SEVERAL ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS TO PUSH THE NOSE DOWN AND THEN KNELT ON MY SEAT AND PUSHED NOSE DOWN ON MY YOKE; TELLING THE FO I WAS ASSISTING THE RECOVERY PROC.

WE WERE BRIEFED TOUGH; TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL AND TO ENSURE THAT WE MET ALL NECESSARY FINAL INTERCEPT REQUIREMENTS. ONE OF OUR CTLRS HAD BEEN DECERTIFIED AND TENSIONS WERE HIGH. THIS WAS ALSO SOON AFTER AN MD80 LANDED SHORT OF THE RWY AT DEN ARPT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SET UP FOR A STABLE APCH. WE HAD JUST BEEN BRIEFED TO ENSURE ALL ACFT WERE SET UP FOR A 'STABLE' APCH. GIVEN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES; AND THE FACT I NEEDED TO ENSURE WAKE TURB SEPARATION WITH TFC IN TRAIL; I ELECTED TO TAKE ACR X OUT OF THE SEQUENCE AND I IMMEDIATELY PUT THEM BACK ON FINAL FOR LNDG. PRESSURE LIKE THIS FROM MY MGMNT IS NOT ONLY CONFUSING; IT IS UNSAFE. I FEEL PRESSURE IS BEING PUT UPON ME AND MY CO-WORKERS TO PUSH THE SAFETY ENVELOPE TO AVOID PLT INQUIRIES.

ON 3 OCCASIONS; DISPATCH LISTED EYW AND MMUN AS ETOPS ALTERNATES. BEING FAMILIAR WITH SOUTH FLORIDA; I DIDN'T QUESTION THOSE ALTERNATES UNTIL; ON THE FIRST FLT; AFTER PASSING THE WEST COAST OF FLORIDA AND BEGINNING OUR OVERWATER PORTION; I ATTEMPTED TO PUT EYW IN THE FIX PAGE OF THE FMC. EYW WAS NOT IN THE DATABASE! I LOOKED UP EYW IN THE APCH PLATES AND FOUND NONE THERE. NQX WAS THERE; HOWEVER. CURIOUS; I PICKED UP THE FOM AND LOOKED FOR EYW IN THE ARPT'S CHAPTER. IT DOES NOT APPEAR! INTERESTINGLY; ONCE AGAIN; NQX DOES. AS A CONSCIENTIOUS CAPT; I FIND IT DISTURBING THAT I AM PROVIDED WITH AN ETOPS ALTERNATE FOR WHICH I HAVE NO DATA WHATSOEVER -- NO RWY LENGTH; WIDTH; APCHS; INFO ABOUT FACILITIES; LIGHTING -- NOTHING. I THINK IT WOULD BE AT THE VERY LEAST IRRESPONSIBLE OF ME TO CHOOSE TO LAND MY AIRPLANE; AND A CRIPPLED ONE AT THAT; AT AN ARPT WITH SUCH A PAUCITY OF INFO. AS SUCH; I STRUCK UP A CONVERSATION WITH THE DISPATCHER QUESTIONING WHY NQX WHICH IS SO CLOSE TO EYW; IS LISTED IN OUR FOM AS AN ONLINE ARPT; AND FOR WHICH I HAVE ARPT DATA; WAS NOT USED INSTEAD. HIS COMMENTS WERE; 'PET INFO IS ADEQUATE ARPT ONLY...JUST A PIECE OF CONCRETE IN CASE YOU FLAME ONE OUT. KEY WEST WILL LOOK LIKE O'HARE TO YOU WHEN THAT HAPPENS!' FIRST OF ALL; I DON'T CONSIDER AN ARPT FOR WHICH I HAVE NO INFO TO BE ADEQUATE! JUST ANY PIECE OF CONCRETE WILL NOT DO! WHEN ASKED ABOUT USING ARPTS FOR WHICH I HAVE NO INFO; HIS RESPONSE WAS; 'WE CAN USE THEM...SURE. IT DEPENDS UPON THE DISPATCHER...I STAY WITH ONLINE STATIONS....' 'ANY ARPT AVAILABLE IS ENRTE WHILE YOU ARE A GLIDER IS ADEQUATE TO ME.' WHEN ASKED WHERE HE'D BE WHEN I WAS SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE FROM THE FAA TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHY I LANDED AT AN UNLISTED ARPT ABOUT WHICH I HAD NO INFO; HE RESPONDED; 'YOU KNOW...LAND NOW...WORRY LATER!' 'I HEARD PENA BLVD CAN HANDLE YOUR ACFT.' I THEN TRIED TO IMPRESS UPON HIM THAT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A COOPERATIVE EFFORT AND I WAS LOOKING FOR A LITTLE HELP HERE. I HAPPEN TO TAKE MY RESPONSIBILITY VERY SERIOUSLY. HE RESPONDED; 'ALL KIDDING ASIDE...WE LOOK AT THAT BUT WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE...5000 FT RWY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE A B757.' 'BUT THAT PET INFO IS JUST THAT -- INFO. IT IS NOT ILLEGAL TO USE KEY WEST.' FUNNY; I THOUGHT UNLESS YOU WERE ON FIRE OR HAD NO OPERATING ENGS; YOU WERE TO USE ONLY THOSE ARPTS LISTED IN THE MANUAL AS REGULAR; ALTERNATE; REFUELING; PROVISIONAL; OR EMER. THAT WOULD MAKE ALL OTHERS ILLEGAL. I AM ALSO BOUND BY FAR PART 91.103; WHICH PARAPHRASED STATES: 'NO PERSON MAY LAND A CIVIL ACFT AT ANY ARPT WITH WHICH HE HAS NOT FAMILIARIZED HIMSELF.' SINCE I HAVE NO MEANS WITH WHICH TO FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH EYW; THEN TO USE IT AS AN ALTERNATE; IN MY MIND; IS IN VIOLATION WITH THAT PART. REGARDLESS OF LEGALITY; ISN'T THE DISPATCHER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE ME WITH INFO (IE; ETOPS ALTERNATES) THAT I CAN USE? HE SAYS 'PET' INFO IS JUST THAT -- INFO. WELL; UNLESS I HAVE APCH PLATES AND RWY INFO; IT IS USELESS INFO! AND IS NOT JUST INFO. IT IS AN ALTERNATE; AND AN UNLISTED ONE AT THAT. EVEN IF I'M ON FIRE; AND ESPECIALLY IF I'VE LOST AN ENG; I NEED ALL THE EXTERNAL HELP I CAN GET TO GUIDE THE JET TO A SAFE LNDG; AND THAT MEANS APCH PLATES AND RWY INFO; PARTICULARLY IF AN ADEQUATE ARPT IS VERY NEARBY. THIS DISPATCHER'S GLIB RESPONSES TO WHAT I CONSIDER REASONABLE QUESTIONING OF A POLICY THAT IS EITHER NOT BEING FOLLOWED; OR THAT DOESN'T ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE PLT WAS DISTURBING TO ME. IF WE DON'T PRESENTLY HAVE A POLICY THAT ONLINE ARPTS AS DEFINED IN THE FOM SHOULD BE THE ONLY ARPTS REFED ON A FLT PLAN; THEN WE SHOULD CERTAINLY MAKE IT POLICY.

THEY HAD FULL RICH DURING THE ATTEMPTED RECOVERY AND THE ENG WOULD NOT RUN. THE ACFT WAS NOT DAMAGED. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 651474: POSSIBLE REASON FOR THE PROB WITH THE R ENG WAS THAT THE MIXTURE WAS SET TOO LEAN. IT WAS NO PROB TRYING TO LAND AT THE ZZZ1 ARPT WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF MIXTURE; BUT IT WAS A PROB AT ZZZ2. WE ALSO DID NOT MAKE A DECISION TO LAND AT THE ZZZ2 ARPT BECAUSE OF OTHER AIRPLANES IN THE TFC PATTERN. 1 ON THE RWY; 3 IN THE PATTERN; 1 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RWY AT ZZZ2.

A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS HAD JUST MOVED OVER THE ARPT A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR EARLIER; LAYERED CLOUDS REMAINED OVER THE ARPT. THE THUNDERSTORMS WERE NOW 40-50 MI E OF THE ARPT AND LIGHTNING COULD BE SEEN. THE ASOS WAS RPTING A FEW CLOUDS AT 2500 FT BROKEN AT 4000 FT; AND OVERCAST AT 5500 FT. I HAD BEEN LISTENING TO THE ASOS OFF AND ON FOR ABOUT 20 MINS BEFORE ARR; AND THE CONDITIONS SEEMED TO BE STABLE AS FAR AS THE CLOUD COVERAGE WAS CONCERNED. I EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO FLY VISUALLY INTO THE LUFKIN ARPT. AT ABOUT 7000 FT I ENTERED THE CLOUDS DURING THE DSCNT; FOLLOWING THE VECTORS THAT I WAS RECEIVING FROM ZHU. I HAD ALREADY SET UP THE COCKPIT FOR A POSSIBLE ILS TO RWY 7; BUT WAS EXPECTING A VISUAL. ABOUT 20 MI W AND AT 5000 FT THE CTLR CLRED ME TO 3000 FT AND 'AN APCH AT LUFKIN.' I ASSUMED THIS MEANT THAT I WAS CLRED FOR THE VISUAL ONLY. AT 10 MI OUT I LEVELED OFF AT 3000 FT AND FOUND MYSELF STILL IN THE CLOUDS. HOWEVER; I DID NOTICE THAT I WAS RIGHT ON THE LOC FOR THE ILS FOR RWY 7; BUT I HAD NOT BEEN CLRED FOR THAT PARTICULAR APCH. I CONTINUED ON AT 3000 FT AND THE IMC PERSISTED. I THEN DECIDED TO CALL THE CTLR TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I WOULD NEED TO FLY THE ILS RWY 7. BEFORE I COULD NOTIFY THE CTLR; HE GAVE HOLDING INSTRUCTIONS TO ANOTHER ACFT INBND TO LFK. THERE WAS CONFUSION BETWEEN THE OTHER PLT AND CTLR REGARDING THE HOLD AND THE FREQUENCY WAS CONGESTED FOR SEVERAL MINS. BY THE TIME THAT THE FREQUENCY FINALLY CLRED I WAS ONLY 3 MI FROM THE ARPT AND STILL AT 3000 FT. I WAS ADVISED THAT I WOULD NEED TO FLY THE FULL PROC. FORTUNATELY THE COCKPIT HAD BEEN ALREADY SET UP FOR THE ILS WHICH RESULTED IN A HIGH BUT MANAGEABLE WORKLOAD. WHILE OUTBND AND DSNDING; I DSNDED BELOW THE CLOUD LAYER INTO ABOUT 5 MI VISIBILITY. AFTER EXECUTING THE PROC TURN THE ARPT CAME INTO VIEW. I WATCHED THE ARPT FOR A FEW MINS TO MAKE SURE THAT CONDITIONS WERE GOOD ENOUGH FOR A VISUAL APCH; THEN NOTIFIED THE CTLR THAT I CAN CANCEL IFR. I FELT HURRIED BECAUSE I KNEW THAT ANOTHER AIRPLANE WAS HOLDING; WAITING FOR ME TO CLR THE AIRSPACE. APPROX ONE MIN AFTER CANCELING IFR THE ARPT LIGHTS SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED. I ASSUMED THAT THE PLT-CONTROLLED LIGHTING TIME HAD EXPIRED AND KEYED MY MICROPHONE TO TURN THE LIGHTS BACK ON. I TRIED THIS SEVERAL TIMES AND THERE SEEMED TO BE NO RESPONSE. I NOW FELT TRAPPED; IMC CONDITIONS EXISTED ABOVE ME; I COULD SEE SPARSE GND LIGHTING IN ALL DIRECTIONS; EXCEPT FOR THE ARPT; AND I KNEW ANOTHER ACFT WOULD BE APCHING THE ARPT. I BECAME SERIOUSLY DISORIENTED. VISUAL CLUES WERE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND I WAS LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR THE ARPT. I INADVERTENTLY ENTERED 45 DEG BANKS WHILE TRYING TO FLY VISUALLY. I ELECTED TO CONTINUE ON AND USED MY GPS AND THE INSTRUMENTS TO NAVIGATE TO THE ARPT. ONCE 3 MILES FROM THE ARPT A LOW CLOUD APPROX 300 FT THICK AND AT 1000 FT AGL BECAME FAINTLY VISIBLE. THIS CLOUD WAS JUST MOVING OVER THE ARPT. I WAS LESS THAN 500 FT ABOVE THIS CLOUD BUT ELECTED TO CONTINUE; DSNDING TOWARDS THE CLOUD AND THE ARPT. APCHING THE TFC PATTERN ALT THE CLOUD BEGAN TO BREAK UP AND THE ARPT BECAME VISIBLE IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE ACFT. THE TFC PATTERN WAS FLOWN VISUALLY AT ABOUT 700 FT AGL AND 'SCUZZY' CONDITIONS EXISTED AT THE TIME. IT WAS TYPICAL SCUD-RUNNING. THE LNDG WAS UNEVENTFUL. WHAT THOUGHTS WERE GOING THROUGH MY HEAD: THE THUNDERSTORMS NEARBY; THE CONGESTION ON THE CTR FREQUENCY WHICH DELAYED MY ABILITY TO EXECUTE MY DESIRED COURSE OF ACTION; MY ASSUMPTION THAT THE WX ABOVE THE ARPT WAS CLR BELOW 3000 FT BASED ON THE ASOS RPT; MY INEXPERIENCE FLYING IN THE TRAIL OF A THUNDERSTORM (THIS WAS MY FIRST EXPOSURE TO THIS). I AM VERY SURPRISED HOW 'RAGGED' THE SKY WAS AFTER THIS STORM HAD COME THROUGH. THERE REALLY WAS NO UNIFORMITY TO THE CLOUDS AS FAR AS BASES AND THICKNESS ARE CONCERNED. THIS CAUGHT ME OFF-GUARD. ALSO; MY REACTION TO THE ARPT DISAPPEARING COULD REALLY BE DESCRIBED AS BEWILDERMENT. IN ALL; IT WAS A VERY CONFUSING SIT FOR ME AND INITIALLYI REALLY STOPPED FLYING THE ACFT. FORTUNATELY; AFTER REALIZING THAT THE VISUAL CLUES WERE INADEQUATE; I WENT BACK TO THE INSTRUMENTS AND FOCUSED ON FLYING THE AIRPLANE. WHAT I REALLY SHOULD HAVE DONE IS EXECUTE A MISSED APCH AND COME BACK FOR ANOTHER ILS; THIS TIME FOLLOWING THE APCH ALL THE WAY TO THE RWY. MY MIND HAD ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT I WOULD BE FLYING VISUALLY. IN MY TRAINING I LEARNED NOT TO GET IN THE WAY OF A THUNDERSTORM; HOWEVER; NO ONE EVER EXPLAINED TO ME THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY CAN AFFECT THE LOCAL WX UP TO 50 MI AWAY. IT BEING NIGHTTIME WAS A HUGE FACTOR; I DOUBT THAT I WOULD HAVE MADE THE SAME DECISIONS DURING THE DAY.",,,,"A BE76 PLT CANCELLED IFR AT LFK WHILE VMC THEN ENTERED IMC.

WX WAS GOOD VFR. WE WERE APCHING THE ARPT FROM THE NE; TO ENTER A R DOWNWIND LEG FOR LNDG ON RWY 35. THE ARPT WAS IN SIGHT AS WE WERE HANDED OFF TO TKI TWR. TWR ADVISED US THAT WE WERE TO FOLLOW AN ACFT ABOUT 2 MI SW OF THE ARPT ON AN APCH TO RWY 35. WE WERE THEN APPROX 2 MI NE OF THE ENTRY POINT TO THE R DOWNWIND AT AN ALT OF ABOUT 2100 FT MSL (1500 FT AGL). AS WE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT XMISSION; OUR ONBOARD TCASII SYS ISSUED A TA OF 'TFC; TFC.' THE FO CHKED THE TCASII DISPLAY AND ADVISED ME THAT THE TARGET WAS AT OUR 1 O'CLOCK POS AND 100 FT ABOVE OUR ALT. SIMULTANEOUSLY; THE TWR ADVISED US TO LOOK FOR TFC AHEAD AND TO OUR R. WE HAD EASILY SIGHTED THE TFC BY THIS TIME; WHICH WAS CLRLY EBOUND AND DEFINITELY APPEARED TO BE IN A CONFLICTING POS WITH OUR FLT PATH SO I IMMEDIATELY INITIATED A MODERATE R-HAND TURN TOWARDS THE PATTERN UPWIND; IN ORDER TO PASS BEHIND THE TFC. WHILE I DID NOT HAVE VERY MUCH TIME TO LOOK AT THE OTHER ACFT; IT DID NOT APPEAR TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION OF ANY KIND. AS I WAS STARTING TO ROLL OUT OF THE R TURN IN ORDER TO RE-ENTER THE DOWNWIND; THE TCASII ISSUED AN RA OF 'DSND; DSND.' WE WERE NOW PASSING BEHIND THE TFC AT THEIR 8 O'CLOCK POS; WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE ABOUT 3/4 MI OF SEPARATION. AS WE WERE NOW CLR OF THE TFC (AND DIVERGING); I DID NOT DSND AS WE WERE NOW IN THE TFC PATTERN AT THE PROPER ALT. AT THIS TIME THE TWR CTLR CALLED THE OTHER ACFT AND SAID SOMETHING LIKE 'I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME A NW DEP.' AFTER A FEW SECONDS; A FEMALE VOICE REPLIED; 'NE DEP.' I ROLLED OUT ON A HDG APPROPRIATE FOR THE DOWNWIND AND PROCEEDED SBOUND. WE SIGHTED THE TFC ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED BY THE TWR; ON SHORT FINAL; AND FOLLOWED THAT ACFT TO AN UNEVENTFUL LNDG. AFTER CLRING THE RWY; I MENTIONED TO THE TWR CTLR THAT WE WERE CERTAINLY GLAD TO HAVE HAD TCASII ON BOARD; EVEN THOUGH HE HAD MADE A VERY TIMELY ADVISORY ABOUT THE TFC. HE STATED THAT 'WE JUST CHKED THE TAPES AND THEY HAD DEFINITELY REQUESTED A NW DEP (WHICH WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM AWAY FROM OUR POS). I SUBSEQUENTLY THANKED HIM AGAIN FOR PICKING UP THE CONFLICT AND FOR THE HELPFUL ADVISORY. NO ONE IN OUR ACFT WAS INJURED BY THE MANEUVERING; NOR EVEN APPEARED TO BE ALARMED. THEY DID ASK ABOUT 'THAT R TURN' AND ALSO ASKED WHETHER OUR EQUIP (TCASII) HAD WORKED AS ADVERTISED. THEY SEEMED AT EASE WITH THE SIT. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE EVENT: 1) THE PLT OF THE OTHER ACFT SIMPLY TURNED THE WRONG WAY AFTER HAVING BEEN CLRED FOR TKOF WITH A NW DEP. 2) MCKINNEY ARPT IS A VERY NICE SATELLITE ARPT FOR THE DALLAS METRO AREA; WITH A FIRST CLASS CTL TWR; INST APCHS AND NO OBSTRUCTIONS. IT IS A POPULAR ARPT FOR STUDENT TRAINING AND FOR BUSINESS TFC NEEDING EFFICIENT ACCESS TO THE DALLAS AREA. CONSEQUENTLY; THERE IS OFTEN A MIX OF TFC IN THE PATTERN INVOLVING HIGH PERFORMANCE ACFT WITH LOW PERFORMANCE ACFT PLTED BY LESS EXPERIENCED PLTS. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE OUTCOME: 1) GOOD PERFORMANCE BY ONBOARD TCASII. 2) CAREFUL MONITORING OF TFC AND TIMELY ADVISORIES BY MCKINNEY CTLRS. 3) GOOD CREW COORD AND USE OF TCASII/RADIO TO AVOID CONFLICTS.",,,,"C550 FLT CREW ON VISUAL APCH RESPONDS TO TCASII AND CTLR TA'S TO AVOID TFC WHICH FAILED TO ADHERE TO STATED DEP HDG.",

WHILE CONDUCTING DOOR DRILLS; I'VE FOUND TWO AIRPLANES MISSING THE RING ON THE BOTTOM RELEASE PIN FOR THE COCKPIT DOOR. ON A PREVIOUS OCCASION; THE RING WAS PRESENT; BUT ALREADY PULLED INTO AN EGG SHAPE. WE'VE BEEN COMPLETING TRAINING BY SACRIFICING SOMEBODY'S KEY RING FOR THE CAUSE SINCE MECHANICS AT THE HANGAR HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO COME UP WITH A NEW RING IN ANYTHING LESS THAN AN HOUR. THE RING APPEARS TO BE MADE OF TIN. (THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO BE REPLACED AFTER A TRAINING SESSION; AND WILL ONLY STAND UP TO BEING USED A HALF DOZEN TIMES.) I SUSPECT THAT THE LOWER RINGS ARE BEING BROKEN OR PULLED LOOSE BY CREW BAGS BEING TOSSED IN THE DOORWAY DURING CREW CHANGES. AS ANYONE WHO HAS REMOVED THE DOOR FROM THE HINGES CAN ATTEST; EGRESS IS CUMBERSOME AT BEST EVEN WHEN THE PULL RINGS ON THE PINS ARE PRESENT. WITHOUT THE RING; WE TURN DIFFICULT INTO NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE; AND TURN THE AIRPLANE INTO A FIRE TRAP. I SUGGEST CHKING THE CONDITION OF THE DOOR RELEASE PINS WHEN YOU GET A NEW AIRPLANE. I'M GOING TO USE 'PINS' ON THE ACCEPTANCE CHK AS A REMINDER; TOO. WE USE TO CARRY EXTRA RINGS IN THE SPARE BULBS KIT; BUT NO MORE; ACCORDING TO MAINT.

WX WAS NOT A FACTOR. DEP AND ARR TERMINAL WX WERE BOTH CLR WITH UNRESTR VISIBILITY; DRY RWYS AND LIGHT WINDS. ENRTE WX WAS CLR. THE FLT CREW CONDUCTED A PREFLT INSPECTION; INCLUDING INSPECTION OF THE LNDG GEAR; WHICH REVEALED NO ABNORMALITIES. TKOF WAS MADE AT XA21Z AT A WT OF APPROX 64200 LBS; SOME 9000 LBS BELOW MAX TKOF WT. FROM THE FLT DECK THE TKOF APPEARED NORMAL IN ALL RESPECTS. WHEN THE SEATBELT SIGN WAS TURNED OFF; THE FLT ATTENDANT CAME TO THE COCKPIT AND RPTED HEARING AND FEELING A RELATIVELY SOLID 'THUMP' EARLY IN THE TKOF ROLL. ON REFLECTION; THE COCKPIT CREW ALSO RECALLED HEARING A NOISE THAT BOTH HAD ASSUMED TO BE THE NOSEWHEEL RUNNING OVER A RECESSED RWY CTRLINE LIGHT -- A COMMON OCCURRENCE. VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS; SAN JUAN ATC ADVISED THAT SOMEONE ON THE GND HAD OBSERVED A TIRE SEPARATE FROM THE AIRPLANE DURING TKOF AND THAT OPS PERSONNEL WERE IN THE PROCESS OF RECOVERING IT FROM BESIDE THE RWY. A PHONE CALL WAS PLACED FROM THE AIRPLANE TO THE GND OPS STAFF AND THE IDENTING MARKINGS ON THE TIRE CONFIRMED IT TO BE THE SAME AS THE TIRES INSTALLED ON THE MAIN LNDG GEAR. NO ABNORMALITIES WITH THE AIRPLANE WERE EVIDENT: HYD PRESSURES AND QUANTITIES; FUEL TANK DEPLETION RATES AND PRESSURIZATION INDICATIONS INCLUDING OUTFLOW VALVE POS WERE ALL NORMAL AND HAD BEEN SO SINCE THE AFTER TKOF CHK WAS COMPLETED. THERE WAS NO UNUSUAL NOISE OR VIBRATION APPARENT ANYWHERE IN THE AIRPLANE. ACFT WT AT THIS TIME WAS APPROX 63000 LBS; SOME 4500 LBS IN EXCESS OF THE MAX LNDG WT AND A FURTHER 90 MINS OF FLT TIME WOULD BE REQUIRED BEFORE THE AIRPLANE WOULD BE AT MAX LNDG WT. THESE FACTORS CONSIDERED; THE FLT WAS CONTINUED TO MIAMI. ZMA WAS INFORMED OF THE ABNORMALITY AND AN UNEVENTFUL LNDG WAS MADE ON RWY 8R. WHEN THE AIRPLANE CLRED THE RWY; EMER PERSONNEL RPTED ONE OF THE L MAIN TIRES MISSING BUT NO OTHER ABNORMALITIES EVIDENT. THE AIRPLANE TAXIING CHARACTERISTICS AT THIS POINT WERE NORMAL AND BRAKING WAS NORMAL; SO THE AIRPLANE WAS TAXIED TO AN OPEN PARKING AREA ON THE RAMP AND SHUT DOWN.

THE FLT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN ABOUT 1 HR. THE CEILING AT ZZZ1 WAS 1500 FT ON TKOF AND THE FORECAST AT ZZZ2 WAS 900 FT. MANY LOCATIONS IN BTWN WERE BELOW MINIMUMS. I FILED ZZZ3 AS MY ALTERNATE. ABOUT 10 MINS INTO THE FLT; WHILE IMC AT 6000 FT WHILE FLYING FROM ZZZ1 VOR TO ABC INTXN; I NOTICED STATIC ON BOTH RADIOS. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; ATC COULD NOT HEAR ME ALTHOUGH I COULD HEAR THEM. WHEN ASKED TO RECYCLE MY XPONDER; I SAW THAT IT WAS NOT OPERATING EVEN THOUGH IT WAS TURNED ON. NEXT I GOT AN INOP FLAG ON THE HSI AND THEN THE WHOLE PANEL WENT BLACK FOR A SHORT TIME. I SAW THAT THE AMP NEEDLE WAS NEGATIVE; SO I SHUT OFF THE ALTERNATOR; WAITED A WHILE; AND TURNED IT BACK ON IN AN EFFORT TO RESET THE INTERNAL CIRCUIT BREAKER. IT DID NOT WORK. I HAD A HANDHELD GPS WORKING ON AN EXTERNAL BATTERY. WITH THIS; I KEPT FLYING THE CORRECT COURSE AT 6000 FT. I TRIED TO DECLARE AN EMER; BUT NO ONE COULD HEAR ME. MY INITIAL CONCERN WAS GETTING VERTIGO WHILE IMC SINCE I HAD TO REACH DOWN TO GET MY HANDHELD MIKE AND OTHER THINGS. ABOUT 30 MI SW OF ZZZ1 AT 6000 FT; I BROKE OUT OF THE CLOUDS. IN ORDER TO AVOID RE-ENTERING THE CLOUDS AND RISKING VERTIGO; I HAD TO CLB TO 10000 FT. THIS GAVE ME TIME TO GET OUT MY HANDHELD RADIO AND ATTACH IT TO AN EXTERNAL ANTENNA. FINALLY I WAS ABLE TO REACH ATC; DECLARE AN EMER AND RETURN TO ZZZ1. AT 10 MI FROM ZZZ1; I LOWERED THE GEAR MANUALLY AND REQUESTED A RAPID DSCNT TO THE ARPT AT ZZZ1. I WAS TOLD TO DSND TO 5000 FT. I ARRIVED AT 5000 FT OVER ZZZ1 HEADING W. I WAS THEN CLRED TO 3000 FT. I TURNED ON THE BATTERY AND MY GPS. I ENTERED AND ACTIVATED THE ILS. I WAS CLRED FOR THE APCH; THEN CLRED TO LAND; AND DID SO. AFTER TAXIING OFF THE RWY; THE ALTERNATOR MAGICALLY STARTED WORKING AGAIN. HOW TO AVOID THIS PROB: 1) THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF ALARM OR WARNING WHEN AN ALTERNATOR FAILS. 2) CHKING THE ALTERNATOR SHOULD BE PART OF EVERY PREFLT -- IFR OR VFR. 3) EVERY IFR AIRPLANE SHOULD HAVE A BACK-UP ALTERNATOR. 4) EVERY IFR AIRPLANE SHOULD HAVE ALTERNATE NAV AND COM TOOLS WITH INDEPENDENT ELECTRICAL SOURCES.",,,,"AN A36 ALTERNATOR FAILED WHILE IMC BUT WITH BOTH A HANDHELD GPS AND RADIO; THE PLT CONTACTED ATC FOR RETURN LAND CLRNC.",

ESTIMATED TIME IN RTE WAS 2 HRS. MY FRIEND OBTAINED AN IFR WX BRIEFING FOR THE RTE AND INFORMED ME THAT CONDITIONS WERE MVFR MID WAY ALONG THE RTE AND THERE WAS AN AIRMET FOR MODERATE RIME/MIXED ICE. THE BRIEFER INFORMED HIM THAT PIREPS SEEMED TO INDICATE ICING TO OUR E; THOUGH HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF IT BEING ALONG OUR RTE OF FLT. WE DEPARTED VFR IN ORDER TO GET OFF THE GND FASTER. MY INTENTION WAS TO MAKE ZZZ2 SOON AFTER SUNSET; AS I KNEW THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY WE WERE GOING TO BE IMC AND I PREFER TO AVOID NIGHT IMC IN MY C172. APPROX 20 MI S OF ZZZ1; THE CEILING STARTED TO COME DOWN RAPIDLY. WE MADE A TURN BACK N AND I INSTRUCTED MY FRIEND TO CONTACT ARTCC FOR A POP-UP IFR CLRNC; AS I ASKED HIM TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RADIOS ON THIS FLT. WE WERE HANDLED IN A VERY PROFESSIONAL MANNER AND AS I TURNED BACK S WE WERE CLRED DIRECT TO ZZZ2 AT 6000 FT. I REQUESTED THIS ALT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT MIGHT PUT US ABOVE A LAYER AND OUT OF THE CLOUDS. AS IT TURNED OUT; 6000 FT KEPT US IN SOLID IMC. WE DILIGENTLY WATCHED FOR ICING AND FOUND NO SIGNS FOR THE FIRST 20 MINS. AROUND THE VOR; A VERY LIGHT FROST STARTED TO ACCUMULATE ON THE WINDSHIELD AND THE LEADING EDGE OF THE WING. I REQUESTED 8000 FT AND WAS CLRED TO CLB. I NOTED A SLIGHTLY SLUGGISH CLB PERFORMANCE; BUT DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT; AS WE WERE WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED LBS OF MAX GROSS AND AT A RELATIVELY HIGH ALT. UPON REACHING 8000 FT IT BECAME CLR THAT THE ICING SITUATION WAS GOING TO BE WORSE. THE OUTSIDE AIR TEMP WAS AROUND 23 DEGS F AND THE ICE STARTED TO ACCUMULATE A SLIGHT FASTER RATE. DURING OUR CLB WE PASSED THROUGH A LAYER; SO I REQUESTED 7000 FT TO HOPEFULLY GET VMC AGAIN. ARTCC WAS PROFESSIONAL AS USUAL AND GRANTED THE REQUEST WITHOUT HESITATION. UPON REACHING 7000 FT WE WERE TOLD TO SWITCH TO ZZZ ARTCC AND TO 'EXPECT A LOT OF QUESTIONS.' WE WERE PUZZLED BY THIS STATEMENT; BUT WE DID SWITCH FREQUENCIES AND CHK IN AT 7000 FT. ICE WAS STARTING TO ACCUMULATE AT A GREAT RATE AT THIS POINT AND I HAD TO ADD INCREASINGLY MORE PWR TO KEEP US AT A NORMAL CRUISE SPD. IT WAS AT THIS POINT (APPROX 5 MINS AFTER SWITCHING TO ZZZ ARTCC) THAT I DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO DIVERT. I ASKED MY PAX TO GET THE APCH PLATES AND LOOK FOR AN ALTERNATE. OUR CLOSEST OPTION WAS ZZZ3; BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE AN APCH WE WERE CAPABLE OF COMPLETING. I DECIDED ZZZ WAS A BETTER ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN ILS AND WE WERE ALREADY AT A CONVENIENT INTERCEPT HDG. MY PAX ADVISED ARTCC THAT WE WERE DIVERTING AND WE WERE GIVEN A CLRNC TO 4000 FT AND A HDG OF 210 DEGS TO INTERCEPT THE FINAL APCH COURSE. I TUNED THE #1 NAV RADIO AND IDENTIFIED THE STATION; WHICH WAS APPARENTLY XMITTING CORRECTLY. AT THIS POINT I HAD TO ADD FULL PWR TO MAINTAIN MY ASSIGNED ALT. EVEN WITH FULL PWR; THE ACFT WAS FLYING AT APPROX 80 KTS; 100 KTS BEING THE NORMAL CRUISE SPD. CTR CLRED US FOR THE APCH AND I WAITED FOR THE LOCALIZER NEEDLE TO COME IN. AFTER APPROX 5-10 MINS BECAME CLR THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. THE GS HAD COME IN BUT THE LOC WAS STILL PEGGED FULL L. I TAPPED ON INSTRUMENT FACE; CHKED THE FREQUENCY; AND TOGGLED THE KNOBS TO TRY AND GET A READING. WHEN I TOGGLED THE KNOBS; THE CDI CAME SLIGHTLY OFF FULL DEFLECTION; BUT RETURNED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. ARTCC CONTACTED US TO TELL US WE HAD FLOWN THROUGH THE FINAL APCH COURSE. HE TOLD US WE WERE SOME DIRECTION FROM A FIX; BUT I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT DIRECTION OR WHAT FIX. THE CTLR DID NOT TELL US IF WE WERE N OR S OF COURSE; SIMPLY THAT WE WERE NOT SET UP PROPERLY. AT THIS POINT; I ASKED MY PAX TO DECLARE AN EMER; AS IT WAS CLR WE HAD PICKED UP OVER A QUARTER OF AN INCH OF ICE AND COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE LOC TO FIND THE ARPT. ARTCC DID NOT CONFIRM THE EMER; BUT DID TELL US TO DO A 360 DEG TURN TO INTERCEPT THE FINAL APCH COURSE. THE CTLR ALSO TOLD US WE WERE CLRED TO CLB; AN INSTRUCTION WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE AT THAT TIME. I WAS VERY CONFUSED AT THIS POINT AND BECAME COMPLETELY DISORIENTED WITH REGARDS TO OUR POS. THE COMS BECOME LESS CLR TO ME AT THIS POINT. I REMEMBER THE CTLR REPEATEDLY TELLING US WE WERE W OF COURSE. THIS INSTRUCTION CONFUSED BOTH MY PAX (AN INSTRUMENT RATED; COMMERCIAL PLT) AND MYSELF BECAUSE THE FINAL APCH COURSE TO ZZZ IS 244 DEGS. BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO ID THE GS; I DECIDED TO DSND. I KNEW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT ZZZ IS BETWEEN TWO RIDGES AND I WAS FAIRLY CONFIDENT WE WERE STILL BETWEEN THE TWO. MY PAX CONTACTED ARTCC AND SAID AGAIN; 'WE WANT TO MAKE IT CLR THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ALT AND WE DO NOT HAVE THE LOC. WE NEED A HDG TO THE FINAL APCH COURSE.' THE CTLR THEN TOLD US TO TURN L 15 DEGS AND THEN 20 DEGS MORE. I COMPLIED AND WAS NOW ON A HDG OF APPROX 180 DEGS. ARTCC ADVISED US THAT WE WERE BELOW THEIR RADAR COVERAGE AND TOLD TO CONTACT THEM WHEN WE GOT ON THE GND. AROUND THAT TIME MY PAX AND I WERE ABLE TO SEE STRAIGHT DOWN TO A HWY; BUT NOT FORWARD TOWARDS WHERE WE THOUGHT THE ARPT WAS. I CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE GS DOWN AND REMEMBER CHKING THE ALTIMETER TO GET AN IDEA OF WHERE WE WERE IN RELATION TO THE ELEVATION OF THE ARPT. WHEN WE SAW THE HWY IT WAS AROUND 2100 FT MSL. WITHIN 500 FT MY PAX SPOTTED THE ARPT 90 DEGS TO OUR R. I MADE THE TURN AND LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. WE ADVISED ARTCC WE WERE ON THE GND AND THEY DID NOT ASK FOR ANY MORE INFO OR A RPT. IT IS CLR TO ME NOW AFTER REFLECTING ON THE FLT THAT IF WE WERE IN THE CLOUDS 10 MINS LONGER; BOTH MY PAX AND MYSELF WOULD HAVE PERISHED FROM THE AMOUNT OF ICE ON THE ACFT. LIKE MOST ACCIDENTS; I FEEL THIS FLT HAD A CHAIN OF EVENTS WHICH COULD HAVE LED TO A DIRE SIT. 1) JUDGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING. MY PAX AND I MADE THE DECISION TO TAKE THE FLT (ULTIMATELY MY DECISION) BECAUSE THE WX ON OUR ORIGINAL RETURN DATE OF SUN LOOKED WORSE. BOTH HE AND MYSELF HAD TO RETURN IN ORDER TO MAKE IT TO WORK ON MONDAY. I CLRLY REMEMBER THIS THOUGHT COMING IN TO PLAY AS I MADE THE DECISION TO TAKE THE FLT. 2) WX. THE WX FORECAST WAS; WITHOUT QUESTION; NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR US TO SAFELY COMPLETE THE FLT. IT WAS ALWAYS A PERSONAL RULE OF MINE TO NEVER FLY IMC WHEN THE TEMP IS BELOW FREEZING. I BROKE THAT RULE BECAUSE THE CEILING RPTS INDICATED WE COULD COMPLETE THE FLT VFR IF NEED BE. AS ALWAYS; I GAVE MYSELF AN OUT IN CASE THE SIT WORSENED. WHAT I DID NOT ANTICIPATE WAS HOW RAPIDLY THE ICE FORMED ON THE ACFT AND HOW FEW OPTIONS WE HAD FOR ARPTS ALONG THE RTE. I AM FAMILIAR WITH THIS RTE AND KNOW THE TERRAIN TO BE VERY RUGGED AND UNFORGIVING. HAD I STOPPED TO THINK ABOUT JUST THIS ONE FACTOR; I WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THE FLT. 3) THE EQUIPMENT. I KNEW FROM OUR FLT FROM ZZZ2 TO ZZZ1 THE DAY BEFORE THAT BOTH COM AND NAV 2 WERE INOP. IN ADDITION; I DISCOVERED DURING THE RUN-UP PROC THAT THE L SEAT (MINE AS THE PIC) PUSH TO TALK WAS NOT FUNCTIONAL. THIS LEFT US ONLY ONE WAY TO COM AND NAV. AGAIN; ON A NICE VFR DAY THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A PROB. IN IMC APCHING DUSK; IT BECAME A MAJOR HAZARD. I'M STILL NOT CERTAIN IF MY RADIO MALFUNCTIONED OR IF THE LOC WAS OTS; BUT IF THE SECOND NAV WERE WORKING; I WOULD HAVE HAD ANOTHER OPTION. 4) MY PAX. AS IS THE CASE WITH MOST PLTS WITH MY EXPERIENCE LEVEL; I HAVE LITTLE WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF OPERATING WITHIN A FLT CREW. I KNEW MY PAX WELL AND TRUSTED HIM TO BE ABLE TO COM AND NAVIGATE WITHOUT MY ASSISTANCE. IT BECAME CLR AFTER DEPARTING ZZZ1 THAT HE WAS NOT CURRENT IN INSTRUMENT OPS AND NEEDED SOME ASSISTANCE WITH THE RADIOS. MORE IMPORTANTLY; I ASSUMED THAT BECAUSE HE WAS A PLT; WE HAD AN ADDITIONAL SAFETY FACTOR. IN REALITY; HAD HE NOT BEEN THERE; I WOULD HAVE NOT TAKEN THE FLT. THUS; IT IS EVIDENT TO ME NOW THAT HE PROVIDED AN ABSOLUTE FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY FOR ME THAT CONTRIBUTED TO MY POOR DECISION TO DEPART. 5) MY CURRENCY. THOUGH I WAS INSTRUMENT CURRENT AT THE TIME OF THE FLT; I HAD NO EXPERIENCE IN ICING CONDITIONS AND APPROX ONLY 6 HRS IN ACTUAL IMC. I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT MY FLYING DURING THE INCIDENT; BUT MY LACK OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WAS STAGGERING. HAD I BEEN MORE AWARE OF OUR POS IN RELATION TO THE LOC; I WOULD HAVE NOTICED THE PROB SOONER AND BEEN MORE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH ATC'S INSTRUCTIONS. AS IT WAS; I WAS COMPLETELY AT THE MERCY OF A CTLR WHO I FEEL DID AN INADEQUATE JOB OF HELPING ME FIND THE FINAL APCH COURSE. WHEN WE WERE TOLD WE WERE W OF COURSE; I WAS SO CONFUSED THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO EVEN IDENTIFY THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE ARPT; MUCH LESS THE COURSE IN RELATION TO OUR POS. EVERY TIME I GET IN AN AIRPLANE I LOOK TO TAKE SOME NEW PIECE KNOWLEDGE OUT OF THE FLT. OBVIOUSLY; THE LESSONS ARE ENDLESS ON A FLT LIKE THIS; BUT I BELIEVE IT CAN BE SUMMED UP IN A FEW WAYS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT EVERY PLT NEEDS LIMITS AND NEEDS TO STICK TO THOSE LIMITS. I'M AT A FAIRLY DANGEROUS TIME IN MY FLYING CAREER WHERE I HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE TO BE CONFIDENT; BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REALLY KNOW BETTER. IN THE FUTURE; I WILL BE MORE DISCIPLINED ABOUT STICKING TO LIMITS; ALMOST ALL OF WHICH I CROSSED WITH THIS FLT. I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN ANY PIECE OF MY PREFLT DATA AND MADE THE DECISION TO NOT FLY. NOT ONLY WAS THE WX POOR AND BEYOND MY EQUIPMENT'S CAPABILITIES; BUT THE LIMITED EQUIPMENT I HAD WAS NOT ALL FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. ALSO IT IS NOW VERY EVIDENT THAT AN ADDITIONAL PLT IN THE COCKPIT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY MAKE THE SITUATION SAFER. IN FACT; IT CAN MAKE IT WORSE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT YOU TRUST TWO PLTS TO GET OUT OF ANY SIT. THIS IN AND OF ITSELF MAY BE ENOUGH TO PUT YOU IN A POS BEYOND BOTH OF YOUR CAPABILITIES; AS IT DID THIS FLT. FINALLY; CURRENCY AND TRAINING IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. IN THE FUTURE; I PLAN TO SPEND MORE TIME WORKING ON UNUSUAL AND EMER SITS. UP TO THIS POINT MUCH OF MY INSTRUMENT TRAINING AND FLYING HAS BEEN LARGELY NORMAL. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 652801: WE WERE TOLD BY GND PERSONNEL THAT SEVERAL OTHER ACFT HAD DECLARED EMERS COMING IN TO ZZZ THAT AFTERNOON. ALL IN ALL; IT WAS AN EXTREMELY FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE; ONE THAT I HOPE NEVER TO REPEAT. I'VE CERTAINLY GAINED A VERY REAL APPRECIATION FOR THE DANGERS POSED BY ICING. FRANKLY; I DOUBT THAT I'LL EVER AGAIN CONTEMPLATE FLYING A LIGHT ACFT (WITHOUT PROPER EQUIPMENT) INTO SITS IN WHICH ICING IS EVEN A POSSIBILITY. I CONSIDER IT A MINOR MIRACLE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PUT THE ACFT DOWN SAFELY ON AN ARPT; AND I FEEL PRETTY LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.",,,,"TWO COMMERCIAL PLTS IN A C172 ENCOUNTER DETERIORATING WX; OPEN AN IFR FLT PLAN AND CONTINUE INTO AN ENCOUNTER WITH ICING CONDITIONS THAT REQUIRE THE DECLARATION OF AN EMER.",

A FRONT WAS MOVING THROUGH THE AREA REQUIRING A SE RADAR CONFIGN DUE TO WINDS. THE LOC APCH WAS IN USE AND DUE TO CLOUD COVER VISUAL APCHS WERE NOT AVAILABLE. THE DEVELOPMENTAL WAS RUNNING CLOSE SEQUENCES TO THE FINAL APCH COURSE. 2 F16'S CHKED IN IFR RETURNING TO BASE. I DID NOT HEAR THEIR REQUEST FOR A 'RADAR TRAIL RECOVERY' (A NEW TERM ADDED TO OUR LOA DEC/2004). TFC INCREASED TO MODERATE. THE DEVELOPMENTAL SEQUENCED THE CL60 BEHIND THE F16'S ON THE FINAL APCH COURSE. A SPD REDUCTION WAS ISSUED TO THE CL60 BUT HE DID NOT SLOW SOON ENOUGH TO BE EFFECTIVE IN MAINTAINING SEPARATION THROUGHOUT THE APCH TO LNDG. WHEN I REALIZED THIS; I INSTRUCTED THE DEVELOPMENTAL TO BREAK OUT THE CL60 HDG 020 DEGS. (I WAS CONCERNED WITH MAINTAINING 4 NM SEPARATION WITH THE PRECEDING F16 FORMATION FLT.) ABOUT THIS TIME; LCL CTL INFORMED US OF A PRIMARY TARGET AHEAD OF THE CL60 THAT HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE THE SECOND F16 (WINGMAN). THIS ACFT HAD NOT BEEN ASSIGNED A XPONDER CODE AS I BELIEVED HE WAS IN THE FLT. I AGAIN INSTRUCTED THE DEVELOPMENTAL TO BREAK OUT THE CL60. SEPARATION WAS LOST AS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT 1.2 NM SEPARATION HAD EXISTED BTWN THE SECOND F16 WHICH FELL 2 MI BEHIND THE LEAD ON THE LOC AND THE CL60 IN TRAIL. LESSONS LEARNED: 1) WHEN CONDUCTING A CERTIFICATION SKILL CHK; BE EXTRA VIGILANT FOR MISSED INFO OR MISCOM. 2) DO NOT ASSUME PAST DEVELOPMENTAL PERFORMANCE IS ANY INDICATION OR PREDICTION OF PRESENT PERFORMANCE. 3) PROFICIENCY AND COMFORT LEVEL IS NOT GREAT ON THE LESS USED RWY CONFIGNS; AS IT IS ON STANDARD OPERATING CONFIGNS. 4) INTERVENE BEFORE REACHING YOUR MINIMUM COMFORT LEVEL. 5) TERMINATE A CERTIFICATION SKILL CHK AT THE FIRST SIGN THAT STANDARDS ARE NOT BEING MET. 6) ALWAYS ENSURE A BEACON CODE IS ASSIGNED TO THE FINAL ELEMENT IN A FORMATION FLT WHEN A RADAR TRAIL RECOVERY IS BEING CONDUCTED. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) AS A SUPVR; MAINTAIN MORE THAN THE MINIMUM REQUIRED PROFICIENCY TIME ON ALL POS (ONLY 4 HRS EVERY 30 DAYS ARE REQUIRED -- TOTAL ALL RADAR POS). 2) ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN PROFICIENCY WHEN OPS ARE IN USE ON THE LESS USED CONFIGNS. 3) SPREAD YOUR PROFICIENCY TIME OUT OVER THE 30 DAY PERIOD SO THAT A GREATER LEVEL OF PROFICIENCY IS MAINTAINED. (PREVIOUS; I WOULD ONLY GET TO RADAR FROM CAB 1 DAY A MONTH TO MAINTAIN REQUIRED PROFICIENCY TIME.) 4) PERFORM CERTIFICATION SKILL CHKS AS AN OBSERVER WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL'S OJTI RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POS ALLOWING COMPLETE ATTN TOWARD EVALUATING PERFORMANCE. 5) POS YOURSELF DIRECTLY BEHIND THE DEVELOPMENTAL AND DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE RADAR POS TO ALLOW THE SAME VIEW THAT IS SEEN BY THE DEVELOPMENTAL. CONCLUSIONS: MANY YRS ATC WITHOUT A RPTED ERROR. AS THE ATC WORK FORCE AGES (ME) PROFICIENCY DECREASES. MORE TIME IS NEEDED THAN THE MINIMUM 4 HR RADAR/4 HR CAB EVERY 30 DAYS. SUPVRS ARE DIRECTED TO WORK OUR PROFICIENCY TIME DURING LIGHT TFC PERIODS FURTHER DECREASING OUR SKILL AND PROFICIENCY LEVELS -- SKILLS THAT MAY BE NEEDED WHEN PERFORMING CERTIFICATION SKILL CHKS AS IN THIS CASE.",,,,"FAT SUPVR CTLR EXPERIENCED OPERROR AS DEVELOPMENTAL CTLR WAS LATE IN BOTH RECOGNIZING POTENTIAL LOSS OF SEPARATION AND THEN RELAYING THE SUPVR'S CTL INSTRUCTIONS.",

THE MEL CARD FOR AIRSPD INDICATOR REQUIRES THAT THE EADI SPD TAPE FOR THE AFFECTED SIDE 'MUST OPERATE NORMALLY.' DUE TO THE INOP FUEL QUANTITY; CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE FMC AND VNAV ARE INHIBITED. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DISPLAY CERTAIN INFO ON THE EADI SPD TAPE (VREF; VFE; HIGH SPD BUFFET AND MINIMUM MANEUVERING SPD). THE AIRSPD FUNCTION; VNE AND MCP COMMANDED AIRSPDS ARE DISPLAYED.

AFTER OUR RETURN TO THE GATE; I CONTACTED MAINT CTLR FOR ADDITIONAL INFO. THE MAINT CTLR HAD MADE A DETERMINATION THAT THE LACK OF FMC INPUTS DID NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MEL FOR THE FUEL QUANTITY INDICATOR BECAUSE THE FMC COULD NOT GENERATE SPD INFO FOR THE EADI SPD TAPE.

ON THE FLT DOWN; I HAD BEEN SHOWING HIM THE GARMIN'S ABILITY TO LIST VARIOUS ARPT FREQS AND PUT THEM IN THE STANDBY POS OF THE #1 COMRDO. AFTER CLRING SGJ CLASS D AIRSPACE; I TUNED UP THE CRG ATIS AND RECORDED ATIS. WHEN 10 MI FROM THE ARPT; I CALLED 'CRAIG TWR' AND RPTED IN. I WAS CLRED TO ENTER A R DOWNWIND FOR RWY 13. THIS WAS MISTAKE #1. I NEVER PICKED UP ON THE FACT THAT IT WAS RWY 13 AND THAT CRAIG DOESN'T HAVE A RWY 13. CRAIG ARPT CURRENTLY HAS ONE RWY UNDER RENOVATION AND ALL TFC IS USING RWY 5/23. I HEARD WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR AND STUPIDLY ASSUMED I WAS CLRED TO LAND ON THE RECIPROCAL OF RWY 23 (WE HAD DEPARTED ON RWY 23). I EVEN COMMENTED TO MY FRIEND THAT THE WINDS HAD SHIFTED TO THE E. AS WE GOT CLOSER; I SIGHTED A CESSNA AT THE SAME ALT OFF OUR L WING WHO LOOKED LIKE HE WAS ALSO SETTING UP FOR THE RWY. I CALLED TWR AND RPTED HIM AND WAS TOLD HE WAS NOT TALKING TO TWR (WE WERE NOW ABOUT 3-4 MI FROM THE FIELD). I TOLD TWR I WAS GOING TO DO A R 360 DEG TURN FOR SEPARATION; AND TWR AGREED. AFTER THE TURN; I CONTINUED IN; RPTED TURNING TO BASE AND THEN TO FINAL. WHILE ON BASE; I HEARD TWR TELL A CESSNA TO HOLD SHORT FOR A PLANE ON FINAL AND COULD CLRLY SEE A PLANE HOLDING SHORT OF THE RWY AS I TURNED TO FINAL. WHEN PASSING THROUGH 400 FT (LINED UP FOR RWY 5 AT CRG); MY FRIEND SAID 'HEY; THAT IS RWY 5; WE ARE CLRED FOR RWY 13!' I INITIATED AN IMMEDIATE GAR AND CALLED TWR APOLOGIZING FOR LINING UP FOR THE WRONG RWY. TWR REPLIED THAT THERE WAS NO RWY 5 AT ST AUGUSTINE. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD HEARD 'ST AUGUSTINE' ON THE FREQ. EVERYBODY HAD JUST BEEN SAYING TWR.' LOOKING AT THE GARMIN; I REALIZED I HAD NOT FLIPPED THE STANDBY FREQ (CRAIG TWR) TO THE ACTIVE POS. I TOLD ST AUGUSTINE TWR I WAS AT CRAIG AND ON THE WRONG FREQ. I THEN SHIFTED FREQS AND CHKED IN WITH CRAIG TWR AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED. THEY CLRED ME TO JOIN THE PATTERN AND LAND. CONTRIBUTING FACTOR: I AM STILL NEW TO USING THE GARMIN. WHILE A GREAT PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY; YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY ENSURE THE 'FREQ LIST' PAGE IS DISPLAYING FREQS FOR THE DESIRED ARPT. WHEN I CHKED IN WITH 'CRAIG TWR' ON THE ST AUGUSTINE TWR FREQ; THE CTLR IGNORED THE WRONG ARPT CALL-UP AND ASSUMED I WAS CALLING ST AUGUSTINE TWR (I'M GUESSING). SINCE EVERYONE JUST USED 'TWR' THERE WAS NO FURTHER OPPORTUNITY TO REALIZE IT WAS THE WRONG ARPT TWR FREQ. I AM NEW TO FLYING AT CRG AND DO NOT KNOW THE RWY NUMBERS BY HEART. HAD I BEEN MORE FAMILIAR (OR BOTHERED TO CHK) THE CLRNC FOR RWY 13 WOULD HAVE TIPPED ME OFF. BOTTOM LINE: THIS AIRSPACE VIOLATION TOOK PLACE BECAUSE I WAS ON THE WRONG FREQ. IT STILL COMES BACK TO THE BASICS; AND MAKING SURE YOU ARE ON THE CORRECT FREQ IS AS BASIC AS IT GETS.

A STATIC TKOF WAS PERFORMED AND I CALLED OUT 'V1; ROTATE' AT APPROX THE TOUCHDOWN ZONE OF RWY 27. A NORMAL ROTATION WAS ACHIEVED. I ESTIMATE WE CLRED THE SMALL (50 FT?)

I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT 99.9% OF OUR TKOFS ARE LIMITED BY THE STRUCTURE OF THE ACFT (MAX TKOF WT AND MAX TKOF WT CONSIDERING BURN AND MAX LNDG WT). THIS LIMIT IS PRINTED IN THE TKOF AND LNDG RPT AS -- MAX FLT PLAN TKOF WT. THIS NUMBER CONSIDERS ALL FLT PLANNING LIMITS EXCEPT THE MAX RWY TKOF WT. THIS NUMBER (MAX RWY TKOF WT) CONSIDERS FACTORS SUCH AS FLAP SETTING; OUTSIDE AIR TEMP; ALTIMETER SETTINGS; WIND; ICING; AND RWY LENGTH TO ENSURE A TKOF THAT COMPLIES WITH THE REQUIRED CLB GRADIENT AND OTHER FAR'S. THIS TKOF WAS LIMITED BY THE MAX RWY TKOF WT. THE RWY IS ONLY 4801 FT. WE HAD AN EXCEPTIONALLY LONG TKOF ROLL BECAUSE OUR ACTUAL WT WAS MUCH GREATER THAN THE MAX RWY TKOF WT. A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THIS EVENT WAS THE TERMINOLOGY IN OUR POH. WITH THE TERM 'MAX FLT PLAN TKOF WT;' ONE CAN EASILY BE LED TO BELIEVE THAT RWY LENGTH HAS BEEN CONSIDERED. I LEARNED 2 VERY IMPORTANT LESSONS: 1) ALWAYS LISTEN TO THAT VOICE IN YOUR HEAD SCREAMING; 'SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT!' I COMMENTED AT THE GATE ABOUT THE UNUSUAL CONCERNS OF THE GND CREW. IT WAS REALLY OBVIOUS THAT USUALLY CANNOT LOAD A CRJ200 TO THE MAX AND THEY OFTEN HAD TO BUMP PAX TO THE NEXT FLT. THIS WAS THE BIG HINT THAT WE NEGLECTED. 2) IT IS EXTREMELY EASY TO BECOME COMPLACENT. WE ARE RARELY LIMITED BY MAX RWY TKOF WT; BUT IT MUST BE CONSIDERED ON EVERY TKOF. I GUARANTEE THAT I WILL PERSONALLY ENSURE THAT THIS IS DONE ON ALL OF MY FUTURE TKOFS.",,,,"CRJ200 FLT CREW MISCALCULATES MAX ALLOWABLE TKOF WT FROM EYW.",

THIS N POINT IS 2.6 NM PERPENDICULAR TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA/RUSSIA BORDER. WHEN WE WERE WITHIN 2 NM OF THE END POINT OF THIS LINE; I WAS INFORMED BY ZAN THAT I WAS AT THAT TIME 4.8 MI INSIDE OF RUSSIAN AIRSPACE AND THAT ANADYR WAS BECOMING QUITE AGITATED BECAUSE OF OUR INCURSION INTO THEIR AIRSPACE.

SINCE THE AIRSPACE BTWN THE FIR AND INTL BOUNDARY IS RUSSIAN CTLED; THE CREW UNKNOWINGLY TRANSGRESSED INTO RUSSIAN AIRSPACE.

AT THAT POINT I INFORMED HER THAT WE HAD RECEIVED OUR TKOF CLRNC AND WERE ON THE RWY IN OUR TKOF ROLL BEFORE WE OBSERVED THE MERLIN ACFT TAXIING SBOUND ON TXWY M AND THAT WE STOPPED OUR TKOF ROLL IN ORDER TO WATCH THE OTHER ACFT TAXI ACROSS THE RWY IN FRONT OF US. THE TWR SUPVR SAID THAT MY STATEMENT WAS IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH WHAT SHE HAD BEEN TOLD BY HER CREW AND THAT SHE WOULD CONDUCT A FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND CONTACT ME AT A LATER DATE. AT NO TIME WERE WE INFORMED OF THE XING TFC. AT NO TIME DID WE HEAR ANY ATC XMISSIONS TO THE MERLIN (EITHER GND OR LCL). I REQUESTED THAT THE TAPES BE MARKED AND SAVED. THE TWR SUPVR STATED THAT THIS HAD ALREADY BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. OBSERVATIONS: WE WERE LUCKY. BECAUSE OF THE OPEN AREA AND HIGH RATE OF SPD; THE MERLIN CAUGHT OUR ATTN. IN A MORE CONGESTED ARPT AND/OR A MORE RUSHED TKOF SCENARIO; WE MAY HAVE BEEN FURTHER ALONG IN OUR TKOF ROLL WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO STOP PRIOR TO IMPACT. THE CTLRS SEEMED COMPLACENT. ATC TAPES WILL REVEAL SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE CTLRS. THERE WAS NO SUPERVISION IN THE CAB.

THE FLT WAS NORMAL ON DEP; INITIAL CLB AND CRUISE. SOMEWHERE AROUND THE VICINITY OF ZZZ1 AT FL240; THE CAPT AND I SMELLED SOMETHING. APPROX 2 MINS LATER; BOTH THE CAPT AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND NOTICED SMOKE FILLING THE COCKPIT. AT THIS TIME WE KNEW SOMETHING WAS BURNING SOMEWHERE AND PROMPTLY STARTED THE MEMORY ITEMS FOR SMOKE IN THE COCKPIT AND STARTED THE EMER DSCNT. ABOUT 20-30 SECONDS AFTER WE NOTICED THE SMOKE; THE FORWARD FLT ATTENDANT NOTIFIED US THE CABIN WAS QUICKLY FILLING WITH SMOKE. WE LET THEM KNOW THAT WE SAW IT TOO AND WERE TAKING MEASURES. AT THIS TIME THE CAPT ALREADY HAD THE ACFT PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR AN EMER DSCNT AND WAS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH CTR; WHILE I WAS REPOSITIONING MY MASK AND GOGGLES; WITHOUT ANY RESULTS. I NOTICED HIS INABILITY AND TRIED ON MY SIDE. AGAIN THE CTLR COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST. DURING THIS TIME; THE FLT ATTENDANTS ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT US 2-3 MORE TIMES WITHOUT US BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE. WE BOTH THEN RECHKED THE CONFIGN OF THE AUDIO CTL PANEL FOR SUGGESTED POSITIONING AND THEY WERE BOTH SET PROPERLY. AFTER REACHING FRUSTRATION; I RESIGNED TO HAVING TO TALK WITH ONE HAND ON THE HANDHELD MIKE AND ONE ON THE OXYGEN MASK. WHILE THIS SOLVED THE COM PROB; IT PROVED TO BE EXTREMELY COSTLY AS FAR AS UTILIZING MY HANDS FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS OPENING THE MANUAL TO THE PROPER PAGES. THE CAPT NOTICED THAT THE ONLY WAY FOR US TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER WAS TO LIFT THE MASK WITH 1 HAND. HE WAS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE TO ME THAT I SHOULD GET THE EMER CHKLIST THAT IS PROVIDED IN THE STOWAGE BIN TO THE FO'S R. I RETRIEVED THE LIST AND NOTICED THAT CHKLIST FOR SMOKE IN THE COCKPIT IS THE MEMORY ITEMS. I SHOWED THE CAPT THE COMPLETED LIST AND PUT THE CHKLIST AWAY. AT THIS TIME; THE CAPT HAD HIS HANDS FULL FLYING THE PLANE AND I HAD MY HANDS FULL COMMUNICATING WITH CTLRS AND ATTEMPTING TO READ THE CHKLISTS FOR DSCNT AND LNDG WHEN I COULD. AT THIS TIME; BOTH THE CAPT AND I REVERTED BACK TO JUST BEING PLTS AND DOING OUR JOB WITH WHAT WE HAD AVAILABLE. THIS INCLUDES INFO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE. AT NO TIME DURING THIS ORDEAL DID WE HAVE ANY INDICATION OF WHERE THE SMOKE WAS COMING FROM AND; IN MY MIND; NOT HAVING ANY CLUES FROM THE AIRPLANE VIA THE MULTI-FUNCTION WARNING SYS MADE IT WORSE BECAUSE WE COULDN'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO ADD LOGIC TO THE SIT OTHER THAN SOMETHING IS BURNING AND IT VERY WELL COULD BE CLOSE TO THE COCKPIT IF WE WERE GETTING THAT MUCH SMOKE. AT AROUND THIS POINT; WE BROKE OUT INTO VISUAL CONDITIONS AND STARTED LOOKING FOR THE FIELD THAT THE CTLR WAS ATTEMPTING TO SEND US TO. AFTER FAILING TO INITIALLY FIND THE INTENDED FIELD; WE NOTICED THE RACE TRACK AND THE AIRFIELD ASSOCIATED WITH IT. AT THIS POINT THE CAPT MADE THE DECISION THAT WE WOULD LAND THERE AND I AGREED. IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE STRIP WAS LONG ENOUGH TO NOT BE AN ISSUE. THE CTLR THEN INFORMED US THAT IT WAS A 6000 FT RWY AND GAVE US THE APPROPRIATE FREQS. WE THEN COMPLETED THE FINAL CHKLIST AND MADE THE LNDG. WE DISCUSSED; IN THE AIR; IF AN EMER EVAC SHOULD BE EXECUTED AFTER STOPPING AND THE CAPT DECIDED TO EXAMINE THE SIT FURTHER BEFORE ORDERING THE EVAC. I COMPLETELY AGREED. AFTER STOPPING ON THE RAMP; I OPENED THE COCKPIT DOOR TO FIND THAT MOST OF THE SMOKE WAS AT THE TOP OF THE CABIN AND DIDN'T HAVE ANY INDICATION THAT ANY PAX WAS IN ANY IMMEDIATE DANGER. WE THEN HAD THE FLT ATTENDANTS OPEN THE DOORS. ONCE WE OPENED THE DOORS; WE NOTICED FLUID FLOWING FROM THE #2 ENG DRAIN MAST. FURTHER EXAMINATION SHOWED IT WAS OIL. AGAIN; THE MULTI-FUNCTION WARNING SYS NEVER ONCE GAVE ANY INDICATIONS. PERSONALLY; I FEEL THAT THE EMER WAS HANDLED WELL BY ALL 4 MEMBERS OF THE FLT CREW; GIVEN THE HURDLES THAT WE HAD TO DEAL WITH. WITHOUT HELP FROM THE AIRPLANE; INFO AND COM ALIKE; AND WITH THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT TOOK FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE EMER TO SHUTDOWN; I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO GET EVERY SUGGESTED PROC COMPLETED. WE DID WHAT WE COULD WITH THE GIVEN VARIABLES. BOTH OF THE FLT ATTENDANTS REMAINED EXTREMELY CALM AND; THEREFORE; REPRESENTED THE APPROPRIATE DEMEANOR TO KEEP THE PAX CALM.

PRIOR TO DEP WE REVIEWED THE SID TOGETHER. I THOUGHT HE WAS COMPLETELY AWARE OF THE ALT RESTRS. AFTER DEPING (TEB) HE DID NOT STOP THE CLB AT 1500 FT BUT AT 1700 FT; I TOLD HIM HE NEEDED TO DSND TO 1500 FT UNTIL 4.5 DME THEN CLB TO 2000 FT.

YET; EVEN AFTER AN INTERVENTION BY THE CAPT TO RETURN TO 1500 FT THE CLB WAS AGAIN INITIATED PRIOR TO THE 4.5 MI ARC. HE ADVISED THEIR ACFT; ALTHOUGH FMS EQUIPPED; DOES NOT EMPLOY AUTO THROTTLES AND THUS THE FLYING PLT MUST INITIATE ALL THRUST CHANGES. HE STATED THAT; ALTHOUGH THE CO-PLT WAS HAND FLYING; THE FLT DIRECTOR WAS ENGAGED AND WAS COMMANDING A LEVEL OFF WHICH APPARENTLY WAS NOT OBSERVED OR ACTED UPON. HE FELT THAT THE CO-PLT WAS WELL BEHIND THE AIRPLANE AND UNABLE TO CATCH UP.

I WAS STILL DSNDING; USING SPD BRAKES AND LOWERING GEAR AT VLO BUT STILL TOO FAST FOR THE APCH DUE TO THE DSCNT. I REACHED DECISION HT AT THE RWY THRESHOLD BUT WAS STILL HIGH AND FAST AND WAS NOT ABLE TO LAND. THE VISIBILITY WAS GOOD AND ASKED THE TWR CTLR IF I COULD CIRCLE AND LAND ON RWY 33.

THIS PARTICULAR SHIFT WAS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF TOO MANY PEOPLE IN CTL ROOM AT THAT TIME. WHEN TFC AND CONDITIONS WARRANT; I AGREE THAT STAFFING IS NECESSARY. HOWEVER; FOR A 'PENCIL PUSHER' IN WASHINGTON TO MANDATE; BASED ON OPERATIONAL ERRORS; THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN CTL ROOM; OR AREA; IS TYPICAL OF SOMEONE SADISTICALLY TRYING TO MAKE A NAME FOR ONE'S SELF; THUS LEADING BACK TO THE PROB. SECONDLY; DISPLAYS ALLOW FOR PERSONAL PREFERENCES AS TO BRIGHT VOLUME AND FONT SIZE. THE LATTER BEING A FACTOR IN THIS SIT; YOUNGER CTLR WORKING 'RADAR;' MORE 'SEASONED' CTLR WORKING 'RA.' FROM THE ANGLE WHICH 'RA' HAS TO VIEW FLAT PANEL; SMALL FONTS BECOME INDECIPHERABLE REGARDLESS OF BRIGHT VOLUME; AS WITH ALL LCD DISPLAYS (LOOK GREAT STRAIGHT ON; BUT FROM THE SIDE; FORGET IT -- SHADOWS).

I WAS AT THE POINT OF SWINGING THE GEAR AND I LOOKED AROUND AND FOUND NO MECHS NEAR THE FLT CTLS. I TOLD EVERYONE AROUND I WAS GOING TO PRESSURIZE THE #3 HYD SYS. I WENT INTO THE COCKPIT AND FOUND NO PLACARDS AND ALL CIRCUIT BREAKERS IN. I ANNOUNCED THE HYDS ABOUT TO BE PRESSURIZED AND AGAIN NOTICED NO ONE NEAR ANY OF THE FLT CTLS. I PROCEEDED TO TURN ON THE PUMP AND IN ABOUT 1 SECOND I HEARD A VOICE TO SHUT OFF THE PUMP. UPON INSPECTION; I FOUND TOILET PAPER WEDGED BTWN THE AILERONS AND THE OUTBOARD FLAPS. BOTH AILERONS AND THE R-HAND OUTBOARD FLAP WERE DAMAGED. THE FLT CTLS ON THIS ACFT RETURN TO NEUTRAL WHEN HYD PRESSURE IS TURNED ON. I DISCOVERED THE MECHS WORKING ON THE AILERONS USED THE ROLLS OF TOILET PAPER TO HOLD THE AILERON UP FOR EASE OF INSTALLATION. THEY REMOVED THE PAPER WHEN THEY DID THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT TESTS ALONG WITH THE PLACARD IN THE COCKPIT. WHEN THEY WENT TO CLOSE UP; THEY WEDGED THE AILERONS UP AND FORGOT THE PULLED CIRCUIT BREAKERS AND TO REPLACE THE PLACARD. OF THE MANY THINGS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS; COMPLACENCY IS ABOUT THE BIGGEST. I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE TURNED ON SYS WITHOUT INCIDENT. THE MAINT MANUALS DID PLAY A PART IN THIS. THERE WAS SEVERAL REFS TO THE AILERON PULLEY REPLACEMENT. ALONG WITH THE MAINT MANUAL; THERE IS A SVC BULLETIN OUT; TOO. THEY ARE DIFFERENT AS FAR AS SETTING UP THE JOB. THE NEXT SHIFT ENDED UP CHANGING BOTH AILERONS AND THE R-HAND OUTBOARD FLAP. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE AIRPLANE WAS A CRJ200 AND UNDERGOING AN AILERON CABLE CHANGE AND THE TECHNICIANS NOT HAVING THE CORRECT TOOLING TO DEFLECT THE AILERONS UP WHILE REPLACING THE CABLES WEDGED TOILET PAPER ROLLS BTWN THE AILERONS AND FLAPS.

MAINT COORD WITH OPS AND SAID ZZZ2 DID INDEED HAVE A GPU FOR STARTING. AFTER SOME DISCUSSION; WE DEPARTED FOR ZZZ2. THE FOLLOWING MORNING; AFTER EXACTLY 9 HRS AT THE HOTEL AND OUR RPT TIME REDUCED TO 30 MINS; WE WERE READY FOR A GND PNEUMATIC AIR START. AT STARTER ROTATION; PNEUMATIC PRESSURE DECREASED FROM 40 PSI TO 10 PSI AND THE START AUTO ABORTED DUE TO A HUNG START. WE CHKED THE GPU -- IT WAS FOR AN RJ; NOT AN AIRBUS; AND HAD INSUFFICIENT VOLUME OF AIR TO TURN THE ENG.

NOT JUST FOR VERIFYING THE STATUS OF THE AIRPLANE; BUT FOR COORDINATING MEL COMPLIANCE; AND WORKING WITH THE GND CREW TO GET THE AIRPLANE GOING. 2) THE GND PERSONNEL ARE NOT TRAINED (NOT WELL TRAINED?) IN PNEUMATIC AIR STARTS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THE AIR PRESSURE UP. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE IDEA OF SCHEDULING AN ACFT APPROPRIATE FOR THE FLT INSTEAD OF PUTTING THE CAPT IN A POS TO REFUSE THE AIRPLANE CLOSE TO DEP TIME? 3) ZZZ2 DOES NOT HAVE THE APPROPRIATE GND EQUIP TO ACCEPT AN AIRBUS WITH AN INOP APU. 4) MINIMUM REST; NUMEROUS MAINT ISSUES; ADDITIONAL PROCS; AND NORMAL PREFLT PLANNING DUTIES COUPLED WITH A 30 MIN REDUCED RPT TIME ARE CONSPIRING TO SET US UP FOR AN INCIDENT.

THE ANNOYING AUDIO SIT SUBSIDED MOMENTARILY; AND WE RECONFIRMED OUR CLRNC INCLUDING THE COMMENT THAT SOMEONE HAD A STUCK MIKE. WE IMMEDIATELY INVESTIGATED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE STUCK MIKE MAY BE OUR OWN. ACCORDINGLY; WE VERIFIED ALL AUDIO SWITCHES AND SELECTOR POS; AND ULTIMATELY SWITCHED XMITTERS. DURING A PERIOD OF IMPROVED COM; WE COPIED OUR HDOF TO ZHU. AGAIN; WE ENCOUNTERED THE ANNOYING FEEDBACK AND WERE ADVISED BY THE NEW CTLR THAT SOMEONE HAD A STUCK MIKE.

IMMEDIATELY UPON COMPLETING OUR SHUTDOWN CHKS; WE VISITED THE LCL AVIONICS FACILITY AND REQUESTED A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF OUR AUDIO SYS; BOTH XPONDERS AND THE AUTOPLT. THE AUDIO COMPLICATION WAS DUPLICATED AND DETERMINED TO BE AN INTERNAL MALFUNCTION OF A MIKE SWITCH ON THE COPLT'S YOKE. A NEW SWITCH WAS INSTALLED AND HAS RESOLVED THAT PROB. AVIONICS PERSONNEL WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE MODE C FAILURE. HOWEVER; THEY SUGGESTED THE ANTENNAE MAY HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY BLOCKED BY THE FUSELAGE POS.

I THEN CHKED BOTH MAGNETOS AND ENG OIL PRESSURE/TEMP; ALL OF WHICH WERE NORMAL. I WAS OVER ROLLING HILLS AND KNEW I WASN'T GOING TO MAKE THE ARPT.

I APPLIED FULL BRAKE PRESSURE AFTER THE NOSE SETTLED. THE ACFT WAS LANDED WITH ABOUT 75 FT OF GND RUN AND NO DAMAGE. THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE IS BELIEVED TO BE A DROPPED CYLINDER OR VALVE.

I ATTRIBUTE THIS TO PROPER EMER PROCS; AND A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF AERODYNAMICS. MY PRIMARY SAFETY CONCERNS ARE WHY NOBODY ANSWERED ME ON GUARD OR SAW MY XPONDER.

MY MAIN LNDG GEAR TOUCHED DOWN ABOUT 200 FT PAST THE 1000 FT MARKER AND MY NOSEWHEEL SHORTLY THEREAFTER. I BEGAN TO APPLY EVEN BRAKE PRESSURE WHEN THE ACFT YAWED SHARPLY TO THE R. I APPLIED PRESSURE ON THE L RUDDER PEDAL IN ORDER TO CORRECT THE YAW AND MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CTL. THE L RUDDER INPUT DID NOT CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THE ACFT OR STOP THE YAW. I FELT INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF L RUDDER INPUT WOULD ONLY CAUSE A SHARP YAW TO THE L; INCREASING THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE TO THE R AND POSSIBLY ROLLING THE ACFT.

ONCE DIRECTIONAL CTL WAS REGAINED; THE ACFT WAS AT A 45 DEG ANGLE TO THE RWY AND HEADING FOR THE R EDGE. I FELT MY SAFEST OPTION WAS TO KEEP THE ACFT HEADED STRAIGHT; MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CTL AND REAPPLY BRAKE PRESSURE.

THE RECOVERY WAS EXECUTED POORLY AND THERE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF ALT. THERE WERE AT LEAST 3 MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THIS UNCTLED FLT ALMOST INTO TERRAIN. THE FIRST CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS MY LACK OF CURRENCY IN THIS TYPE OF ACFT. I HAD NOT FLOWN THIS TYPE OF ACFT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. TO SAY I WAS RUSTY IN THIS TYPE OF CANARD ACFT WOULD BE KIND. THE SECOND CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS THE LACK OF A PROPER PREFLT. I WILL EXPLAIN LATER; BUT AN ASSUMPTION ON MY PART LED TO A VERY SLOW ROLL RATE AND A DEEP STALL. THE THIRD FACTOR WAS NOT ALLOWING ENOUGH HEIGHT ABOVE THE TERRAIN IN A HIGH DENSITY ALT ENVIRONMENT TO RECOVER FROM A BOTCHED MANEUVER. I HAVE BEEN AVERAGING 85 HRS A MONTH IN DISSIMILAR ACFT AT SEA LEVEL ARPTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. HOWEVER; I AM CURRENTLY PLANNING A XCOUNTRY TO DELIVER THIS ACFT TO THE NEW OWNER. I THOUGHT I WOULD GET CURRENT AND RE-FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH THE ACFT BEFORE TAKING IT XCOUNTRY BY DOING SOME AIR WORK AND THEN SOME PATTERN WORK. I PICKED A CLR DAY BUT THE WINDS WERE QUITE STRONG FOR A RE-FAMILIARIZATION FLT. LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT THE STRONG WINDS AT ALT WOULD LATER BE A CONTRIBUTING PART TO A STRING OF ERRORS THAT LED TO A NEAR FATAL ACCIDENT. THE TKOF AND CLBOUT WERE RUSHED BUT UNEVENTFUL. I WENT TO AN OPEN FIELD THAT I HAD USED BEFORE TO DO THE AIR WORK. THE AIR WORK FIRST CONSISTED OF TURNS. THAT IS; L AND R TURNS OF EVER INCREASING BANK ANGLES. THEN I DECIDED TO DO TURNS ABOUT A POINT AND THAT LED EVENTUALLY TO AN INADVERTENT DEATH SPIRAL FOLLOWED BY A VERY SLOW RECOVERY. THE ONLY THING THAT FELT SLIGHTLY OUT OF ORDER DURING THE PRACTICE TURNS WAS THE ROLL RATE OF THE ACFT. I HAD BEEN GINGERLY ROLLING IN AND OUT OF L AND R TURNS. THE GREATER THE BANK ANGLE; THE SLOWER THE ROLL RATE. I ASSUMED THIS WAS DUE TO HIGHER G'S AND THE HIGHER SPDS. I WAS WRONG; BUT DID NOT KNOW IT AT THE TIME. WHAT I DID NOT REALIZE AT THE TIME WAS THE AILERONS WERE LIMITED BOTH IN THEIR RATE OF MOVEMENT AND THE RANGE OF MOVEMENT BY THE IMPROPER APPLICATION OF NON STRETCHING GAP SEALING TAPE. MY WIFE; THE WK BEFORE; AT MY REQUEST; TO MAKE THE ACFT LOOK BETTER IN ORDER TO CINCH THE SALE OF IT; HAD APPLIED; WHAT I THOUGHT; WAS STRETCHABLE GAP SEALING TAPE; TO THE FLT CTLS. THIS TAPE WAS APPLIED SO THAT WHEN THE NEW BUYER CAME TO PURCHASE THE PLANE; IT JUST LOOKED BETTER. SHE HAD INADVERTENTLY APPLIED THE NON STRETCHABLE TAPE TO ALL THE CTL SURFACES AS WELL AS TO THE GAPS IN THE WINGS AND PANELS. THE NON STRETCHING TAPE; WHICH I DID NOT CATCH ON THE PREFLT INSPECTION OR DURING RUSHED AND SLOPPILY DONE FLT CTL MOVEMENT CHK PRIOR TO TKOF; I BELIEVED; COMBINED WITH MY LATE RECOGNITION OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO MY ACFT; DURING A POORLY EXECUTED TURN ABOUT A POINT; CONTRIBUTED TO MY DEEP STALL SPIRAL AND SUBSEQUENT SLOW RECOVERY. AFTER THE TURNS; I DECIDED TO DO TURNS ABOUT A POINT BOTH L AND R. THE L TURNS WERE MARGINALLY OK. THE R TURNS; HOWEVER; DID NOT SEEM TO BE WORKING AT ALL. I KEEP DRIFTING AWAY FROM THE FIELD AND OVER A POPULATED AREA NEXT TO IT; DUE TO THE STRONGER THAN EXPECTED WINDS AT ALT. AT FIRST; I WAS NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THIS DRIFTING; BUT I WAS JUST FRUSTRATED THAT I COULD NOT DO A SIMPLE TURN ABOUT A POINT. I HAD GONE AROUND APPROX 3 TIMES TO THE R DURING WHICH I JUST KEPT INCREASING THE BANK ANGLE AND INCREASING THE G'S TO COUNTERACT THE DRIFTING OF THE ACFT UNTIL I FINALLY; BUT SLOWLY REALIZED; THE ALT HAD BEEN AND WAS NOW RAPIDLY DECREASING. THERE IS NO STALL WARNING IN THIS ACFT; THERE IS ONLY A HIGH RATE OF SINK. I INITIATED A RECOVERY AND ADDED FULL PWR. IT SEEMED LIKE THE PLANE WAS ROLLING IN MUSH. THE CTLS; THOUGH RESPONDING; SEEMED TO TAKE FOREVER TO GET THE WINGS LEVEL. ALL THE WHILE I WAS RAPIDLY APCHING THE TERRAIN. THE RECOVERY WAS MADE WAY TOO LOW TO THE GND BECAUSE I DID NOT START ANY OF MY MANEUVERS WITH THE ANTICIPATION OF ANY ALT LOSS OR THE SUBSEQUENT DRIFTING OVER HIGHER TERRAIN. RECOVERY WAS SLOW DUE TOMY LATE RECOGNITION OF THE ALT LOSS AND LOW AIRSPD. RAPID LOSS OF ALT WAS CAUSED IN PART BY THE HIGH DENSITY ALT ENVIRONMENT. ALL OF THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO A NEAR FATAL DEEP STALL DEATH SPIRAL. WHEN I RETURNED TO THE PATTERN; AFTER CALMING MY HEART RATE DOWN TO BELOW 100+ BPM; I REALIZED THAT THE ROLL RATE WAS REALLY SLUGGISH. I KEPT OVERSHOOTING THE BASE AND FINAL TURNS DUE TO THE STRONG WINDS AND NOW QUITE APPARENT SLOW ROLL RATES OF THE ACFT. AFTER I LANDED; I CAREFULLY INSPECTED THE PLANE FOR FLT CTL PROBS AND CAME TO REALIZE WHAT HAD HAPPENED WITH THE TAPING. I REMOVED THE TAPE. WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER? I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN DUAL FLT TIME WITH ANOTHER CANARD PLT TO KNOCK THE RUST OFF. BUT I DID NOT WANT TO BE A BOTHER TO AN OVERWORKED FRIEND WHO HAD THE ONLY OTHER DUAL CANARD TRAINER ON THE FIELD. I COULD HAVE POSTPONED MY XCOUNTRY FLT AND GOTTEN THE DUAL TRAINING. I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A SAFETY OBSERVER THAT DAY; BUT HE HAD TURNED ME DOWN WHEN I ASKED HIM JUST PRIOR TO THE FLT; SIGHTING LACK OF TIME ON HIS PART. I COULD HAVE WAITED FOR ANOTHER DAY TO FLY WITH HIM. I COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER PREFLT AND DISCOVERED THAT THE WRONG KIND OF TAPE HAD BEEN APPLIED TO THE FLT CTLS. INSTEAD; I JUST ASSUMED IT HAD BEEN DONE CORRECTLY. I COULD HAVE IGNORED THE GND TFC BEHIND ME JUST PRIOR TO TKOF AND DONE A PROPER FLT CTL CHK RATHER THAN HURRYING TO TAKE OFF TO PLEASE MY FELLOW PLT. I SHOULD HAVE CLBED TO A HIGHER ALT ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT I MIGHT JUST MAKE A MISTAKE ON ONE OF THE MANEUVERS DUE TO MY LACK OF CURRENCY. I HAD THE WRONG ATTITUDE FOR SAFE FLYING THAT DAY. I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED AFTER EACH 360 DEG TURN AND CHKED MY ALT AND LOCATION TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS MAINTAINING A SAFE MARGIN ABOVE THE GND AND AWAY FROM POPULATIONS. BUT I WAS IMPATIENT WITH MYSELF TO DO THE MANEUVER CORRECTLY. PRIDE GOETH BEFORE THE FALL; LITERALLY IN THIS CASE. I SHOULD HAVE PICKED A LARGER FIELD AT A LOWER ABSOLUTE ALT WITH FEWER OBSTACLES; AND A LOWER POPULATION DENSITY NEARBY TO COMPENSATE FOR THE WINDS AND HIGH DENSITY ALT THAT WERE OCCURRING THAT DAY. I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT BETTER ABOUT WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO AND HOW I WAS GOING TO ACCOMPLISH IT PRIOR TO GETTING IN THE PLANE THAT DAY. I RUSHED TO TAKE OFF; TRAIN AND ALMOST DIED FOR HURRYING.",,,,"A RUTAN LONG EZ PLT TOOK OFF WITH TAPE COVERING THE WING AILERON GAPS AND SUBSEQUENTLY DURING STEEP TURNS STALLED; NEARLY IMPACTING THE GND DURING RECOVERY.",

WITH FUEL STILL ONBOARD; WE JACKED UP THE ACFT AND I REPLACED THE PULLEYS REQUIRED ON THE L WING. I DID NOT REPLACE THE PULLEY REQUIRED ON THE R WING BECAUSE THERE WAS ONLY ONE TENSION REGULATOR LOCK BAR; AND IT WAS IN USE ON THE L WING.

THE DE-FUELING WAS OVERRULED BY THE PROGRAM MANAGER WHO STATED THE CABLE CLRNC HAD ALREADY BEEN CHKED BEFORE THE PULLEYS WERE REPLACED. KEEPING IN MIND THE CABLES WERE ALREADY FOUND SLACK ON THE PRELIMINARY INSPECTION. THE AIRPLANE WAS JACKED AND THE PULLEY REPLACEMENT WAS ACCOMPLISHED ON THE L WING ONLY AS ONLY ONE TENSION REGULATOR WAS AVAILABLE AT THE FACILITY.

THERE WAS AN AIRMET FOR ICING IN WASHINGTON AND OREGON WITH FREEZING LEVELS STARTING AT 3500 FT MSL AND UP TO 4500 FT MSL. I DSNDED FROM ENRTE CRUISING ALT OF 3000 FT MSL TO GET UNDER THE CLOUD LAYER AT HIO. I LEFT FLT FOLLOWING FROM PORTLAND CTR AND HAD NOT SWITCHED OVER TO HIO TWR. I DSNDED IN THE ACFT TO AROUND 2300 FT MSL AND SCANNED TO OBSERVE THAT I WAS CLR OF THE CLOUD LAYER AS WELL AS CLOUDS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF MY ACFT. CONTINUING MY SCAN OUT THE FRONT WINDOW OF THE AIRPLANE; I OBSERVED THAT HIO WAS A SHORT DISTANCE AHEAD. AT THIS TIME I REALIZED THAT I WAS LOW ENOUGH TO BE IN HIO AIRSPACE. I QUICKLY CHKED THE GPS; AND OBSERVED THAT I WAS INSIDE HIO CLASS D SURFACE AIRSPACE. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED APPROX 90 DEGS TO MY R TO HEAD AWAY FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE ARPT. ON ROLLOUT; I OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIABLE SINGLE ENG ACFT FLYING DIRECTLY TOWARDS MY POS UNDER THE CLOUD LAYER AS WELL. I PROCEEDED TO TURN THE ACFT TO THE R TO EVADE THE ACFT PER RIGHT-OF-WAY RULES. I THEN ROLLED OUT ON A NORTHERLY HDG AND PROCEEDED OUT OF HIO CLASS D AIRSPACE. HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS: THE SPACE BTWN THE SCATTERED LAYER AND THE OVCST LAYER COULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY CLR ENOUGH TO FLY BTWN THE LAYERS AROUND 4000-4500 FT WITHOUT CAUSING ICING CONDITIONS.

I; THE SAFETY PLT; WAS IN THE PROCESS OF FILING AN IFR FLT PLAN FROM OVERHEAD ZZZ VOR TO ZZZ2. AS I WAS ON THE RADIO TO FSS; THE L ENG FAILED ABRUPTLY. THE PROP FEATHERED ITSELF BEFORE WE COULD TAKE ACTION. WE CONTINUED WITH THE TROUBLESHOOT PROCS; AND ATTEMPTED TWICE TO AIR START THE L ENG. RESTART ATTEMPTS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL; HOWEVER; SO WE ELECTED TO SECURE THE INOP ENG AND LAND AS QUICKLY AS PRACTICABLE. THE NEAREST ARPT WAS ZZZ. AT NIGHT; ZZZ IS UNCTLED. BEFORE LNDG; WE CALLED THE CTR FREQ TO LET THEM KNOW OF OUR PROB; AND TO INQUIRE AS TO WHETHER THERE WERE ANY INBOUND FLTS. WE DID NOT DECLARE AN EMER. WE LANDED ON RWY 22; THE LNDG WAS SUCCESSFUL. UPON A MECH'S INSPECTION THE FOLLOWING DAY; IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS AN UNCERTAIN AMOUNT OF JET-A FUEL IN EACH OF OUR FUEL TANKS. WE HAD STOPPED AT NEARBY ZZZ3 FOR FUEL 10 MINS PRIOR TO THE ENG FAILURE. WE HAD CALLED THE ARPT THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON TO INQUIRE ABOUT AFTER HRS FUELING; AND ABOUT AVAILABILITY OF 100LL FUEL. WE WERE TOLD THAT THE PUMP WOULD BE LOCKED; BUT THAT THE KEYS WOULD BE LEFT ON TOP OF THE FIRST AID BOX IN THE MAIN BUILDING. UPON ARRIVING; WE LOCATED THE KEYS AND A FUEL PUMP BY THE BUILDING. THERE WERE NO MARKINGS ON THE TANK; WHICH WE HAVE LEARNED WAS RECENTLY PAINTED WHITE. THE KEYS WERE FOUND; UNLOCKED THE PUMP; WHICH WE THEN USED TO REFUEL OUR ACFT. THE JET-A TANK HAS RECENTLY BEEN REPAINTED WHITE; AND THE JET-A MARKINGS ON IT HAVE PROBABLY BEEN PAINTED OVER BY MISTAKE. THE 100LL PUMPS ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RAMP. ALTHOUGH LIT; AT NIGHT THEY ARE NOT VISIBLE BECAUSE THE CITY HAS NEGLECTED TO MAINTAIN THE LIGHTS; WHICH ARE AT THE MOMENT INOP. WE TOOK ON A TOTAL OF 50 GALLONS OF JET-A; AND HAD 60 GALLONS OF 100LL REMAINING IN THE TANKS. THROUGHOUT THE EMER; THE R SIDE ENG DEVELOPED FULL PWR AND DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY SIGN OF STRESS OR FATIGUE. DURING THE INSPECTIONS PERFORMED THE FOLLOWING DAY; THE INOP ENG WAS PARTIALLY DISASSEMBLED AND THE PROP WAS REMOVED. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE MAGNETO TIMING HAD BEEN INCORRECTLY PERFORMED AT THE 100 HR INSPECTION; WHICH HAD BEEN CONCLUDED THE PREVIOUS DAY. THE SPARK PLUGS SHOWED EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT FOULING. UPON DISASSEMBLING THE PROP; A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DEPOSIT WAS FOUND IN THE PROP HUB AND AROUND THE PROP SHAFT; WHERE THE OIL PLUMBING TO THE PROP HUB IS TO BE FOUND. WE WERE TOLD BY THE MECHS THAT; ALTHOUGH THESE DEPOSITS ARE A NORMAL PRODUCT OF THE ENG; THEY SHOULD BE CLRED AT EVERY 100 HR INSPECTION. WE WERE TOLD BY THE MECHS THAT SUCH A DEPOSIT WAS EVIDENCE THAT THE OP HAD NOT BEEN PERFORMED DURING THE PREVIOUS 100 HR INSPECTION. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 654588: THE PREVIOUS DAY I CALLED THE ARPT MGR AND ASKED IF 100LL FUEL WAS AVAILABLE 24 HRS. HE SAID YES; AND GAVE ME THE DIRECTIONS TO FIND THE KEY WHICH UNLOCKS THE SELF-SERVE. APPARENTLY IT WAS ON THE HONOR SYS AND AFTER FILL-UP; THE CUSTOMER LEAVES QUANTITY AND ADDRESS FOR BILLING. AFTER WE LANDED AT ZZZ LATE AT NIGHT WE TAXIED TOWARD THE ARPT MAIN BUILDING TO FIND THE PUMPS. THERE WERE NO LIGHTS EXCEPT FOR THE MAIN BUILDING; BUT WE SAW THE SELF-SERVE WITH OUR LNDG LIGHT. WE GOT THE KEY; UNLOCKED THE PUMP; AND FILLED UP 25 GALLONS A SIDE (TOTAL CAPACITY IN 2 TANKS IS 110 GALLONS);LOCKED THE PUMPS; RETURNED THE KEYS; PREFLTED; SUMPED FUEL; AND DEPARTED. WE FOUND OUT FROM THE ARPT MGR THE FOLLOWING DAY THAT THE LIGHTS WHICH ILLUMINATED THE 100LL SELF-SERVE BURNT OUT AND HAD NOT BEEN REPLACED AND THAT SOMEONE TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES TO REPAINT THE RUSTY JET-A SELF-SERVE. LACK OF VISIBLE MARKINGS ON THE JET-A SELF-SERVE; ILLUMINATION OF THE 100LL CAUSED US TO REFUEL WITH THE WRONG TYPE OF FUEL. PLT ERROR ALSO CONTRIBUTED AS I/WE DID NOT NOTICE THE SMELL OF THE FUEL WHILE FUELING OR TESTING; POSSIBLY DUE TO FATIGUE FROM A LONG DAY OF FLYING AND EAGERNESS TO CONTINUE TO THE NEXT STOP.

THE JET'S CREW HAD APPARENTLY SEEN US FIRST BECAUSE IT APPEARED TO BE REACTING WITH A R TURNING DSCNT TO A SSE BEARING; AWAY FROM OUR POS. WX CONDITIONS AT THE TIME WERE VMC. AT THE TIME; APPROX XA05; THE SUN WAS IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE SKY; THERE WERE NO CLOUDS AND VISIBILITY WAS GREATER THAN 10 NM. THE WX WAS SO GOOD IN FACT THAT THE 'SEVERE CLR' CONDITIONS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS EVENT BY PROVIDING NO BACKDROP TO PICK UP MOVEMENT. THE GLIDERS BEING DOWN SUN WITH RESPECT TO THE JET'S ORIGINAL COURSE FROM THE W; AND THE LIKELY FLASHING OF SUNLIGHT OFF THE WINGS OF THE 2 BANKED CIRCLING GLIDERS MAY HAVE AIDED IN THE JET' CREW SPOTTING THE GLIDERS. THAT AIRSPACE IS QUITE BUSY. FDK IS ADVERTISED AS MARYLAND'S SECOND BUSIEST ARPT. A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THE FLT ACTIVITY OF FDK IS ASSOCIATED WITH GLIDER OPS. I MADE A RADIO CALL TO POTOMAC ABOUT 2 HRS EARLIER ALERTING THEM OF GLIDER ACTIVITY UP TO 6000 FT NEAR FDK. THE FOLLOWING SUGGESTIONS ARE OFFERED AS SAFETY ENHANCING ACTIONS: 1) THE FDK GLIDER OP AND POTOMAC APCH APPEAR TO HAVE GOOD COORD. NOTIFYING POTOMAC OF GLIDER ACTIVITY UPON ITS INITIATION AND POTOMAC PASSING THAT INFO ROUTINELY TO INBOUND ACFT AT CHK-IN OR VIA ATIS IS MOST HELPFUL. 2) CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO PLACING A NOTICE ON THE IFR PUBS OF HVY VFR OR 'GLIDER ACTIVITY' IN THIS AREA. IT IS CLRLY MARKED ON VFR DOCUMENTS BUT NOT ON THE IFR PLATES BEING USED BY INBOUND TFC TRANSITING THE AIRSPACE. THE VIKES ARR INTO RENO; NV; IS A FINE EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF WARNING TO IFR INBOUND TFC. 3) ADDITIONALLY; APCH PROCS SHOULD BE FLOWN TO KEEP THE TRANSITING IAD BOUND IFR ACFT AT HIGHER ALTS UNTIL ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO DSND. THEIR HIGHER GND SPD AND COCKPIT WORKLOADS MAKE IT RISKY TO OPERATE AT LOWER ALTS WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF VFR TFC IS CONGREGATED.

WE RECEIVED OUR IFR CLRNC ON THE GND AND DEPARTED INTO THE CLOUDS. UPON BREAKING OUT ON TOP; WE ADVISED ATC THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO MANEUVER AND THEN SHOOT SOME ILS APCHS. WE ASKED IF WE COULD STAY ON THE IFR CLRNC BECAUSE WE WOULD ONLY BE MANEUVERING FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND WOULD NEED THE CLRNC TO PENETRATE BACK THROUGH THE LAYER FOR THE APCHS ANYWAY. THE ATC CTLR TOLD US THAT WE WOULD NEED TO CANCEL IFR TO BE ALLOWED TO MANEUVER; BUT SAID THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT WE WOULD NEED AN IFR CLRNC TO COME BACK IN AND THAT WE SHOULD 'ADVISE HIM WHEN READY FOR THE APCHS.' SO WE CANCELED OUR CLRNC AND PERFORMED OUR MANEUVERS. UPON COMPLETION OF THE MANEUVERS; WE ADVISED ATC THAT WE 'WERE READY FOR THOSE APCHS NOW.' THE CTLR ACKNOWLEDGED; GAVE US A VECTOR FOR THE FINAL APCH AND DSNDED US TO A LOWER ALT. ABOUT 2 MINS AFTER IMC PENETRATION; HE HANDED US OFF TO ANOTHER CTLR. UPON CONTACTING THE NEW CTLR; SHE GAVE US A NEW VECTOR AND THE INSTRUCTIONS TO 'REMAIN VFR.' AS SOON AS WE HEARD THOSE WORDS; BOTH MY STUDENT AND I REALIZED THAT WE HAD PENETRATED INTO IMC WITHOUT A CLRNC. ALTHOUGH THE PREVIOUS CTLR HAD GIVEN US ALL OF THE COMPONENTS OF AN AIRBORNE IFR CLRNC; HE HAD NEVER ACTUALLY SAID THE WORDS; 'CLRED TO....' WE QUICKLY ADVISED THE NEW CTLR THAT WE WERE ALREADY IN IMC AND WOULD LIKE A CLRNC. SHE THEN (AFTER CONFIRMING WE WERE IFR RATED AND IN A CAPABLE ACFT) ISSUED US AN IFR CLRNC AND WE CONTINUED THE APCH. WE LANDED AT OUR DEST WITHOUT ANOTHER EVENT AND DEBRIEFED ON WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED. I BELIEVE THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS A COMBINATION OF 2 FACTORS: FIRST; WAS THAT IN THE COURSE OF THE VFR ON TOP MANEUVERS; WE WERE IN CONSTANT ATC CONTACT FOR TA'S; SO I HAD FORGOT THAT WE HAD CANCELED THE IFR CLRNC. SECOND; AND PRIMARY; WAS THE FAILURE ON MY PART TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN FROM ATC FOR THE APCH DID NOT CONSTITUTE A CLRNC. IT HAD BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN ATC GIVES INSTRUCTIONS THAT IS NOT AN IFR CLRNC; THEY WILL ADVISE YOU TO 'REMAIN VFR.' THE FIRST ATC CTLR DID NOT GIVE THAT ADVISORY; AND AS A RESULT I INTERPED THE INSTRUCTIONS AS AN IFR CLRNC. HAD I REALIZED THE FIRST TIME WE CONTACTED THE CTLR THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS FROM ATC DID NOT CONTAIN THE WORDS 'CLRED TO...;' THE INCIDENT WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED.

ACFT ARRIVED AT XA22; GATE X. AT THIS POINT I MET THE ACFT BY MYSELF. MY ASSISTANT STARTED WORK AT XC00. I PROCEEDED TO DO A WALKAROUND THEN MET THE INBOUND CREW AND WAS BRIEFED ON THE STATUS OF THE ACFT. AT APPROX XB10; COMPANY TUG ARRIVED. AT THIS POINT I PREPARED ACFT FOR REPOSITIONING. I INSTALLED BYPASS PIN AND ALL MAIN LNDG GEAR AND NOSE LNDG GEAR PINS. THE TUG WAS THEN SECURED TO THE ACFT. AT APPROX XB20 WE STARTED TO REPOSITION THE ACFT FROM GATE X TO GATE Y. WE ARRIVED AT GATE Y AT APPROX XB30. WE THEN SECURED THE ACFT WITH WHEEL CHOCKS AND THE TUG WAS DISCONNECTED FROM ACFT AND LEFT. I REQUESTED A GPU FROM COMPANY SO THAT I COULD SHUT DOWN APU. I WAITED SEVERAL MINS AND THEN PROCEEDED TO GO DOWNSTAIRS TO REMOVE THE GEAR PINS. DURING THE MAIN GEAR PIN REMOVAL; I WAS CALLED SEVERAL TIMES TO SEE IF GPU WAS WORKING PROPERLY. DURING THIS TIME I WAS ALSO ADVISED BY RAMP PERSONNEL THAT THEY FOUND A SCRATCH AT AFT CARGO DOOR. I WENT TO INSPECT THE DOOR AND FOUND THAT THE PAINT SCRATCH WAS THERE WHEN THE ACFT ARRIVED WITH A RPT ON THE SAME SCRATCH. AT THIS POINT; I TOOK THE GEAR PINS AND PROCEEDED TO THE COCKPIT TO PLACE THEM IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMPARTMENTS. NOT REALIZING THAT THE NOSE PIN WAS STILL INSTALLED; I CONTINUED WITH PREFLT SVC CHK AND CONTINUED TO REPAIR CABIN ITEMS. AT APPROX XD15 WE STARTED TO FUEL THE ACFT AND DURING THIS TIME WE ATTENDED TO ANY DISCREPANCIES THAT WERE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTN BY CABIN CREWS. AT APPROX XE35 WE PERFORMED OUR FINAL WALKAROUND TO CHK ALL ACCESS PANELS AND DOORS FOR SECURITY. MY ASSISTANT PERFORMED HEADSET COM WITH OUTBOUND CREW. THE ACFT DEPARTED AT XE44. AT APPROX XF30 WE RECEIVED A CALL FROM OPS STATING THAT ACFT WAS RETURNING BACK BECAUSE OF LNDG GEAR PROBS. THE ACFT RETURNED AT XF53. DURING MY INVESTIGATION; I REALIZED THE NOSE LNDG GEAR PIN WAS STILL INSTALLED. I REMOVED THE NOSE LNDG GEAR PIN; INSPECTED NOSE LNDG GEAR AREA -- NO DEFECTS WERE NOTED. THE ACFT WAS THEN REFUELED. PERFORMED FINAL CHKS AND ACFT DEPARTED AT XG47. I BELIEVE SEVERAL FACTORS WERE THE CAUSE OF THIS MISHAP. DURING MY GEAR PIN RETRIEVAL; I WAS CALLED SEVERAL TIMES TO ATTEND TO OTHER MATTERS IN WHICH I FEEL BECAME A DISTR AND CAUSING NOSE GEAR PIN TO BE LEFT BEHIND. ALSO; NOT HAVING ANOTHER TECHNICIAN TO HELP WITH THE WORKLOAD DURING ACFT ARR MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN A FACTOR.",,,,"AN A340-300 WAS DISPATCHED AND RETURNED TO THE FIELD WITH A NOSE GEAR RETRACTION PROB.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 655138: WE GOT A MESSAGE 1 MIN AFTER TKOF THAT SAID; 'WTS WRONG RAMP WORKING ON FIX NUMBERS QUESTIONS CONTACT ME USING MISC.' THIS ACARS MESSAGE BEGAN FLASHING AFTER THE INITIAL FLAP RETRACTION FROM 2 DEGS TO 1 DEG. THE COPLT THEN TOLD ME THAT HE HAD 'FULL AFT' STICK AND COULD NOT ROTATE AND ALMOST ASKED ME TO TAKE THE ACFT. I DID NOT SEE THE SPD THAT WE ACTUALLY LIFTED OFF; BUT IT WAS WELL AFTER VR. THE ROTATION WAS MORE LIKE A DELAYED ROTATION SPD FOR WINDSHEAR. THE TKOF DID NOT FEEL 'NORMAL.' THIS DISPATCHER SAID; 'I COPIED YOUR CONVERSATION WITH LP AND GAVE IT TO MGT' WHO IS GIVING IT TO THE LP MGR. WE HAVE PROBS WITH THIS FLT OFTEN DUE TO IT BEING PREDATED. I THINK RAMP CONFUSES NUMBERS BECAUSE OF THAT. YOU MAY WANT TO MENTION THAT IN YOUR RPT.' THE TIME LAPSE FROM GETTING FINAL WTS WAS 5 MINS FROM RECEIPT TO TKOF BECAUSE THE WT WAS HIGHER AND WE HAD TO PUT THAT WT INTO THE ACARS MESSAGE. WE TOOK OUR TIME. 6 MINS LAPSED FROM THE TIME WE GOT THE FINAL WTS TO THE TIME WE GOT THE ACARS MESSAGE THAT THEY WERE WRONG. THE CHAIN OF EVENTS BEGAN WHEN THEY HAD TO RELOAD THE PITS TO SEPARATE AN ANIMAL FROM DRY ICE. PUSH CREW SAID ALL THE PITS WERE FULL. I ASKED THE LP HOW WE COULD AVOID THIS IN THE FUTURE AND HE SAID; 'BETTER CTL;' AS IN THE RAMP HAS TO PAY MORE ATTN TO WHAT THEY ARE DOING. MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT THEY ARE JUST 1 LINK IN A CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE LED TO A HIGH SPD ABORT AFTER V1 AND WHO KNOWS WHAT AFTER THAT. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR REINFORCED THE SAME STATEMENTS MADE IN HIS WRITTEN RPT. THE ADDITIONAL INFO WAS THAT HE FELT THE ACFT HAD TKOF CAPABILITY BECAUSE OF THE SPD INCREASE NOT THE ELEVATOR TRIMMING ITSELF. HE ALSO STATED THAT THE SHOCK OF FULL AFT SIDE STICK WITHOUT ACFT RESPONSE HIT HIM SOMETIME LATER AS AN ALMOST EMOTIONAL SHOCK. HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE 'WHAT IF' THEY COULD NOT GET OFF AT A HIGH SPD. THE CAPT HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE COMPANY; THE FAA; AND UNION TO REVIEW THIS INCIDENT.",,,,"AN A319 TAKING OFF WITH INCORRECT WT AND BAL INFO ROTATED 15-20 KTS ABOVE VR WITH FULL AFT STICK SELECTED AT VR.",

CHKS ON ACFT ON THE GND INDICATED NORMAL OP OF THE REMAINING AUTO CONTROLLER. AT A CRUISE ALT OF FL350 APPROX 150 NM W OF ZZZ; SUDDEN INDICATION OF CABIN PRESSURE GREATER THAN 13000 FT OCCURRED! THIS WAS SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE ECAM OF DUAL AUTO PRESSURIZATION CONTROLLER FAILURE INDICATIONS. INSTANTLY THE FO AND I RAN THE QRC AND DONNED OUR OXYGEN AND ESTABLISHED CREW COM AS WELL AS INITIATED A DSCNT TO WHAT WAS A SAFE ALT AT THAT DISTANCE FROM ZZZ OF 10000 FT. WE WERE LATER ASKED BY ATC TO STOP AT 11000 FT AND THEN CLBED TO 12000 FT TO COMPLY WITH THE MSA WITHIN 25 NM OF ZZZ VOR FROM OUR DIRECTION. LATER WE WERE ALLOWED TO DSND PRIOR TO HOLDING AT ZZZ VOR DOWN TO 10000 FT AS ALL THE HIGH TERRAIN IN THE AREA WAS WELL N OF OUR POS. WE DECLARED AN EMER AND SQUAWKED 7700 (LATER WE WERE ASKED TO SQUAWK XYZA). INITIALLY; AFTER STARTING THE DSCNT; THE FEELING OF THE CREW WAS THAT THE INDICATIONS COULD BE ERRONEOUS AS THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE CHANGES IN THE COCKPIT AND THIS WAS SUPPORTED BY OUR COM WITH THE FLT ATTENDANTS THAT THEY WERE FINE AND THAT THE OXYGEN MASKS HAD NOT DEPLOYED AUTOMATICALLY. THE FO NOTED IN THE EMER DSCNT THE CABIN ALT INDICATING AS HIGH AS FL200. THE CREW; HOWEVER; FOLLOWED THE CHKLIST AND ADVISED THE FLT ATTENDANTS THAT WE WOULD ERR ON THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE AND MANUALLY DEPLOY THE PAX MASKS FROM THE COCKPIT. THIS WORKED WELL AND WITH A THOROUGH EXPLANATION TO THE FLT ATTENDANTS AND PAX ON THE PA; EVERYONE SEEMED PRETTY CALM. AT THE TIME; THE FLT ATTENDANTS STATED THAT THEY FELT FINE; HOWEVER; ON THE BUS RIDE THE NEXT DAY; THEY RPTED THAT THEY WERE STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE LIGHTHEADED. THIS DEPLOYMENT OF MASKS AND COM OCCURRED ABOUT FL280-FL250. AFTER DSNDING TO 11000 FT; IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE CABIN PRESSURE COULD NOT BE REDUCED BELOW 13600 FT AND THE HIGHEST RATE OF DSCNT WE COULD GET THE CONTROLLER TO IN MANUAL WAS 150-300 FPM DOWN. ALL THE WHILE WE COMMUNICATED WITH THE FLT ATTENDANTS TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE ON OXYGEN AND EVERYONE WAS FEELING OK. WE TOLD THE FLT ATTENDANTS TO PERFORM A CABIN ADVISORY; AS WELL AS TO MAKE SURE THE PAX KNEW HOW TO CLR THEIR EARS. WITH THE AUTOPLT ON; THE CAPT INITIATED A 'CALL ME' WITH DISPATCH AND MAINT. THEY INFORMED US TO GO TO 131.3 BUT NO CONTACT WAS MADE WITH THEM IN THE AIR OTHER THAN THE FO MANUALLY TYPING INTO ACARS. DISPATCH INFORMED US EARLY ON OUR MAX LNDG WT FOR ZZZ WAS 170000 LBS. AT THAT TIME WE WERE ABOUT 150000 LBS; HOWEVER; A HVYWT LNDG CHKLIST WOULD HAVE TO BE PERFORMED BEFORE THE A320 PAX FOR THE LIMITS SECTION IS 142.2. THE CAPT HAD ALREADY INFORMED DISPATCH THAT ZZZ WAS THE DESIRED FIELD DUE TO CLR WX AND A 13000 FT RWY ON RWY 8; FOR THE POSSIBLE HEAVIER THAN NORMAL LNDG. AFTER LNDG; THE FO REMINDED EVERYONE TO 'REMAIN SEATED' AND WE TAXIED CLR OF THE RWY WITHOUT INCIDENT AND CHOSE TO STOP ON THE PARALLEL TXWY A PRIOR TO CONTINUING ON TO THE GATE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE WORKING THE PRESSURIZATION PROB THERE VERSUS THE GATE AREA. THE CABIN PRESSURE STILL INDICATED 13900 FT UPON TOUCHDOWN. WE ALSO NOTED THAT THE OUTFLOW VALVE HAD NOT OPENED UPON LNDG AND WE WERE UNABLE TO DEPRESSURIZE THE JET AT THAT TIME. OUR CONFIGN WAS PACKS OFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OVERWT LNDG CHK AND BLEEDS ON. WE ATTEMPTED MANUAL CTL AGAIN AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ECAM WE RAN THE VERT SPD ALL THE WAY UP. THIS RESULTED IN AN OVERPRESSURIZATION FEELING WHICH INCLUDED PRESSURE CHANGES ON THE EARS. WE DECIDED TO LOWER THE VERT SPD MAX DOWN AGAIN AS IT WAS AT LEAST COMFORTABLE THERE. ONCE AGAIN WE ONLY GOT TO 13600 FT AND 150-200 FPM DSCNT RATE. FINALLY WE WERE ABLE TO PARTIALLY TALK TO MAINT ON 131.3; HOWEVER; IT WAS POOR AND THE CAPT USED HIS CELL PHONE TO MAKE CONTACT AND WORK OUT THE REST OF THE ISSUES. MAINT DIRECTED US TO PULL CIRCUIT BREAKER D-9. THIS INITIALLY RESULTED IN A CABIN PRESSURE INDICATION ON THE SYS DISPLAY OF -5500 AND ABOUT 15 SECONDS LATER IT WENT BACK TO 13900 FT. SAMC DIRECTED US TO BREAK THE COLLAR ON CIRCUIT BREAKER Y-22 WHICH WAS THE DEFERRED AUTO CONTROLLER AND IN ADDITION WE PLACED THE CONTROLLER IN AUTO AGAIN. THIS RESULTED IN THE SAME DISPLAY OF -5500 AND THEN 15 SECONDS LATER BACK TO 13900 FT. ALL THIS TIME I HAD THE FO ON OXYGEN JUST IN CASE; WHILE I FELT FINE BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE MY MASK IN MY LAP AND CLOSE AT HAND. THEN WE TRIED SHUTTING OFF THE BLEEDS TO NO AVAIL. FINALLY WE ASKED MAINT WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT US SHUTTING DOWN THE ENGS. THIS RESULTED IN THE OUTFLOW VALVE OPENING AND THE CABIN ALT INITIALLY INDICATED -5500 WITH AMBER VERT SPD RATE OF 2900 FPM; HOWEVER; NO PRESSURIZATION CHANGES WERE NOTED WHICH STILL MADE US FEEL SOMETHING WAS ERRONEOUS.; WE HAD THE FLT ATTENDANT OPEN 1L ONLY AFTER CONFIRMING THAT IT WAS DISARMED AND INFORMED HER TO HOLD THE DOOR LOOSELY WHEN OPENING IT AS WELL AS TO HOLD ON TO THE SUPPORT AT THE DOOR. ALL THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED ONLY AFTER WE CONFIRMED PRESSURE WAS EQUAL ON THE GAUGES AND THAT HER CABIN PRESSURE LIGHTS ON THE DOORS WERE NOT ILLUMINATED (INDICATING EQUAL PRESSURE) AND ENSURING EVERYONE WAS IN THEIR SEATS WITH THEIR SEATBELTS FASTENED. THE DOOR OPENED WITHOUT INCIDENT. WE FINALLY MADE CONTACT WITH STATION OPS AND ASKED FOR A TOW; WHICH COULD NOT BE DONE SINCE ATC DID NOT WANT THEM TO TAXI ACROSS THE PERPENDICULAR RWY 35 AT NIGHT. INSTEAD; WE CHOSE A SINGLE ENG TAXI WITH THE FO'S WINDOW OPEN ALL THE TIME TO PREVENT PRESSURIZATION.

THE PNF RPTED THAT THE FUMES WERE STRONGEST NEAR DOOR 4R AND CONTINUED FOR A FEW SEAT ROWS AFT OF 4R. WE ESTABLISHED COM WITH DISPATCH AND MAINT. AFTER ACCOMPLISHING THE APPROPRIATE IRREGULAR AND EMER PROCS IN THE FLT HANDBOOK AND FOM; WE WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE FUMES.

THE RPTR SENT ONE CREW MEMBER TO THE CABIN TO HELP THE FLT ATTENDANTS AFTER PLACING GUARDS NEAR THE FLT STATION DOOR CONSIDERING THAT THE SMOKE MAY HAVE BEEN A TERRORIST DIVERSION.

MY FO AND I BOTH SPOTTED THE ACFT AS IT BEGAN ITS TKOF ROLL ON RWY 15R. WE BOTH REMARKED OUT LOUD THAT IF IT GOT OFF THE GND QUICKLY; THERE COLD BE A PROB. SURE ENOUGH; THE BRASILIA ROSE RAPIDLY. AT ABOUT 500 FT AGL; I WAS FORCED TO MAKE A MILD EVASIVE MANEUVER; UP AND TO THE L; IN ORDER TO AVOID A COLLISION. (I WAS STILL ABLE TO LAND ON RWY 9.) THE ENCOUNTER GENERATED AN AUDIBLE TCASII TA ALERT. WE LATER ESTIMATED THAT WE'D PASSED ABOUT 300-400 FT FROM THE BRASILIA. WE DON'T KNOW IF THE OTHER CREW EVER SAW US. AS THEY DEPLANED; 3 OF OUR PAX HAD COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 'NEAR MISS.' THIS WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE EXPERIENCE. IF IT IS CURRENTLY HOUSTON TWR'S POLICY TO SIMULTANEOUSLY LAND ARRS ON RWY 9 WHILE LAUNCHING DEPS OFF RWY 15L OR RWY 15R; I THINK THE PROC SHOULD BE REVIEWED IMMEDIATELY.

IT WAS A 'SOFT IFR' DAY AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD DIVERSION TO TAKE MY WIFE FOR A SUNDAY BRUNCH TO APC (NAPA). WHAT IFR FLYING I DID TO APC IN THE PAST ALWAYS INVOLVED THE LOCALIZER APCH FOR RWY 36L. AS PREPARATION I REVIEWED MY COMMERCIAL PLATES; BUT I RECALL STOPPING AT THE PLATE DEPICTING THE GPS APCH RWY 06. MY PLANE ISN'T IFR GPS EQUIPPED. I STUDIED THE (EXPECTED) APCH; NAMELY LOC RWY 36L. I DID NOT LISTEN TO THE APC ATIS BEFORE LEAVING MY HOME. WHILE ENRTE AND 30 MI OUT FROM APC I TUNED IN TO ATIS. IT INDICATED THEY WERE USING THE 'VOR RWY 6' (36? DON'T THEY MEAN THE LOCALIZER RWY 36?). THE TRANSMISSION WAS A BIT BROKEN AND FUZZY. NOT AWARE; THEN; THAT A VOR RWY 6 APCH EVEN EXISTED (NEEDLESS TO SAY; I LEFT MY CHART BOOK WITH ALL THE OTHER PLATES AT HOME); I SOLDIERED ON. OAK CTR WAS ESPECIALLY BUSY AND I HAD ENOUGH DIFFICULTY GETTING THEM TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE MY HANDOFFS. I JUST COULDN'T GET MY QUESTION IN ABOUT THE APC APCH IN USE. PLANES WERE BEING PUT IN HOLDS AND I SUSPECTED THE SAME WOULD BE ASKED OF ME. APC SOUNDED BUSY. I WAS ABOUT 3 TO THE WORTH OF SCAGGS ISLAND VOR (MY FIELD CLRNC LIMIT). STILL NO OAK CTR CTLR; TO ADVISE ME OF THE ACH IN USE; ANTICIPATED DELAY TIME; WHETHER I WAS TO HOLD AT SCAGGS ISLAND OR NOT. I MANAGED TO CALL HIM. HE ADVISED ME TO ANTICIPATE HANDOFF TO ANOTHER OAK CTR FREQUENCY MOMENTARILY; WITH AGAIN NO INSTRUCTION AS TO HOW I WAS TO PROCEED ONCE AT SGD. THIS WHOLE TIME I WAS IN IMC CONDITIONS AT 5000 FT. RELUCTANT TO ENTER A HOLD AT SGD WITHOUT A SPECIFIC CLRNC AND WITH THE FREQUENCY SO BUSY I COULDN'T GET THE SAME CTLR'S ATTENTION. I CROSSED SGD AND CHOSE TO FLY DIRECT LYLLY (THE IAF FOR THE LOC RWY 36L) AND HOLD THERE AT MY ASSIGNED 5000 FT OR UNTIL I COULD GET CTLR'S ATTENTION. IT WAS SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE THAT I WAS HANDED OFF TO THE NEXT OAK CTR CTLR. SHE QUIZZED ME AS TO WHETHER I WAS HOLDING AT SGD. I ANSWERED THAT I WAS NOT; RATHER THAT I WAS AT LYLLY THEN OUTBND ON THE LOCALIZER PENDING FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. SHE THEN PROCEEDED TO VECTOR ME TO THE W...AGAIN NO INSTRUCTIONS AS TO THE APCH IN USE OR ANTICIPATED DELAYS. SHE THEN BEGAN DSNDING ME WITH A FINAL 'VECTOR OF 090 DEGS TO JOIN THE INBND COURSE.' THIS DIDN'T RING RIGHT. I WAS TO THE W OF APC AND 090 DEGS WOULD MAKE AN APPROX 90 DEG INTERCEPT WITH THE RWY 36L LOCALIZER!! I QUERIED ATIS AGAIN (IT WAS JUST AFTER THE HOUR; AND THERE WAS A FRESH ATIS RECORDING). THEY WERE USING THE 'VOR RWY 06' APCH (CEILING 1500 FT BROKEN). WITH NO PLATE AND NO IDEA HOW TO FLY IT; THE 'LIGHT OF DISCOVERY TURNED ON' AND I KNEW IT WAS TIME TO GET OUT OF THERE. THE CTLR WAS ADVISED BY ME THAT I HAD NO PLATE. I REQUESTED AND RECEIVED A CLRNC TO CLB; WITH VECTORS; BACK TO MY HOME ARPT. I CONSIDER MY STRESSED FRAME OF MIND AND MY INSUFFICIENT PREPARATION; MY FAILURE TO LOOK ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE GPS RWY 06 PLATE (THERE IT WAS; THE VOR RWY PLATE; WHEN I RETURNED HOME) AND THEN MY DENIAL TO MYSELF THAT SUCH AN APCH EXISTED; WHILE ENRTE; AS THE BIGGEST PROBS HERE. CONTRIBUTORY; IN MY MIND; WERE THE OVERLY BUSY CTLRS. NO ONE QUERIED MY CHOICE OF HOLDINGS AT LYLLY (WRONG APCH); AND NO CTLR MOUTHED THE WORDS 'VOR 06 APCH' WHILE I WAS ON FREQUENCY...TO ANYONE. I DON'T BELIEVE I CAUSED ANY TFC CONFLICTS OR POSED ANY SAFETY ISSUES HERE. I JUST BELIEVE A SERIES OF LITTLE OMISSIONS LED TO SOME BIG CONFUSION AT THE END.

THE DISTANCE BETWEEN IS 50 NM AND IS OVER MOSTLY UNPOPULATED AND SPARSELY POPULATED COUNTRYSIDE. ZZZ IS A ZZZ2 SATELLITE ARPT UNDER THE 4000 FT RING OF THE CLASS B AIRSPACE. THE FIRST 5-10 MI OF THE TRIP INVOLVES FLYING OVER THE POPULATED NORTHERN SUBURBS. IT IS A RTE I HAVE FLOWN DOZENS OF TIMES AND AM FAMILIAR WITH THE LANDMARKS; TERRAIN AND OBSTACLES. ON THIS DAY; THERE HAD BEEN AREAS OF IMC ASSOCIATED WITH RAIN SHOWERS REDUCING VISIBILITY; ALTHOUGH CEILINGS HAD REMAINED ABOVE 2500 FT. AROUND XA30 THE RAIN SHOWERS HAD MOSTLY DISSIPATED AND THE ARPTS ALONG MY RTE WERE CLRING WITH ZZZ1 RPTING CLR SKIES. AT XB00; I PREPARED TO DEPART ZZZ. ATIS INFO WAS RPTING 4 MI VISIBILITY IN MIST. ALL MORNING I HAD BEEN FOCUSED ON THE VISIBILITY AS CEILING HEIGHTS HAD NOT BEEN A CONCERN. THE LUSCOMBE IS A TWO PLACE VINTAGE TAIL WHEEL AIRPLANE THAT CRUISES AROUND 100 KTS; SO MOST FLTS ARE DONE AT 1000 FT AGL OR BELOW. SINCE I WOULD BE LEAVING THE CLASS D INTO CLASS G AIRSPACE THE CEILING WAS OF LITTLE CONCERN AS LONG AS I HAD BASIC VFR MINS; 1000 FT. ZZZ TWR CLRED ME FOR TKOF WITH A L TURN FOR A W DEP ON COURSE. AT ABOUT 700 FT AGL I BEGAN TO ENTER THE BASES OF A SCUD LAYER WHILE CLBING. AT THIS TIME I WAS ALREADY ON A W HDG ON COURSE. I ASSUMED THIS WAS JUST AN ISOLATED PATCH OF SCUD ASSOCIATED WITH A SHOWER; SO I LEVELED OFF BELOW THE BASES AT AROUND 600 FT AGL. KNOWING THAT CONDITIONS WERE BETTER TO THE W I CONTINUED; WHICH INVOLVED LESS THAN MINIMUM CLOUD CLRNC IN THE CLASS D AIRSPACE; RATHER THAN RETURN TO POOR CONDITIONS AT ZZZ. BY THE TIME I HAD REACHED THE VOR WHICH IS ALONG THE COURSE; CEILINGS HAD IMPROVED IN ADDITION TO ME NOW BEING OUT OF A POPULATED AREA. DURING THE SIX MI BETWEEN ZZZ AND THE VOR WHILE FLYING TO KNOWN BETTER CONDITIONS; I WAS FORCED TO STAY BELOW THE BASES WHICH MAY HAVE COMPROMISED THE MINIMUM HEIGHT ABOVE POPULATED AREAS. BEING FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA AND ANY OBSTACLES IN MY JUDGEMENT ENTERING THE SCUD LAYER WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN COMPROMISING MY ALT. THE REMAINING FLT WAS UNEVENTFUL. UPON LNDG IN ZZZ1; I CALLED ZZZ TWR AND SPOKE WITH THE TWR MGR FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST; TO DETERMINE IF I HAD DEPARTED INTO IFR CONDITIONS. SECONDLY; IF AND WHEN THE AUTOMATED WX OR ATIS HAD RPTED THE LOWER LAYER. HE ASSURED ME THAT IT HAD BEEN VFR AND THAT IS WASN'T UNTIL XB30 THAT AWOS HAD RPTED A 700 FT BROKEN; 1/2 HR AFTER MY DEP. THE TAF FOR THE TIME WAS TEMPO; XC00 TO XE00 800 BROKEN. IN RETROSPECT I WAS TOO FOCUSED ON THE VISIBILITY AT THE TIME AND FAILED TO PAY ATTENTION TO DETERIORATING CEILINGS. TAKING TIME TO REVIEW THE WHOLE WEATHER PICTURE AGAIN AFTER DELAYING WOULD PROBABLY HAVE REVEALED THE PROB.

FUEL DUMPING WAS FINISHED BY ABOUT 6000 FT MSL. THE LNDG WAS OVERWEIGHT BUT VERY SMOOTH ON TOUCHDOWN. FLT ATTENDANTS STAYED IN CONTACT AND SAW NO FURTHER PROBS IN THE BACK; SO WE TAXIED TO A HARDSTAND AND DEPLANED THE PAX WITH STAIRS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: ON REACHING THE GALLEY; NO VISIBLE SMOKE WAS NOTED BUT COULD BE SMELLED THROUGHOUT THE GALLEY AND DOOR 1L OVERHEAD AREA. WHAT STRUCK THE RPTR AS ODD WAS THE RPT OF SMOKE COMING FROM THE OVERHEAD PANEL OF DOOR 1L. THE PURSER HAD ALREADY SWITCHED OFF ALL THE POWER TO THE SEAT POWER PORTS AND ADVISED THAT A PAX HAD RPTED THAT THE FLOOR FELT HOT UNDER THE SEAT. THE CAPT DECLARED AN EMER AND DIVERTED. THE AIRPLANE WAS SCANNED FOR ANY FIRE OR OVERHEAT CONDITIONS AND NONE WERE DISCOVERED UNTIL MAINT SWITCHED ON THE #1 OVEN IN THE GALLEY AND IT SHORTLY OVERHEATED TO AN ABNORMALLY HIGH TEMP.

THE RELIEF PLT WAS ON BREAK AND I TOLD THE FLT ATTENDANT TO AWAKEN HIM TO ASSES THE SIT AND TO STAY ON THE PHONE TO KEEP US INFORMED. THE RELIEF PLT INFORMED ME BY PHONE THAT IT APPEARED TO BE ELECTRICAL SMOKE AND THAT IT WAS SUBSIDING; BUT THAT A PAX IN XX; MR X; HAD INDICATED THAT THE FLOOR BENEATH HIS FOOT WAS VERY HOT. WITH THAT INFO I DECLARED AN EMER AND ASKED FOR VECTORS TO ZZZZ; UPON WHICH WE RECEIVED VECTORS TO RWY 5 ILS. WE STILL HAD FUEL IN THE CENTER TANK AND I ELECTED TO DUMP FUEL IN ORDER TO GET DOWN TO MAXIMUM LNDG WEIGHT. FUEL WAS DUMPED OVER WATER AT 7000 FT AND STOPPED AT 5000 FT APPROX 6000 LBS. ACFT WEIGHT AT LNDG WAS 335000 LBS; AND AN OVERWEIGHT LNDG WAS MADE WITH A SMOOTH TOUCHDOWN; 1-200 FPM; WITH MINIMAL BRAKING (FROM THE TIME NOTIFIED OF THE SMOKE TO LNDG WAS 19 MINS). CRASH AND FIRE RESCUE EQUIP MET THE ACFT ON LNDG; AND AS THERE WAS NO CONTINUING SMOKE OR FIRE; I ELECTED TO TAXI TO THE GATE. ONCE THERE; CFR CREWS SCANNED THE ACFT FOR FIRE WITH NO EVIDENCE THEREOF. PAX AND CREW DEPLANED VIA JET STAIRS WITH NO INJURIES. CFR CREWS WENT OVER ACFT WITH A DEVICE FOR CHKING FOR FIRE. NONE WAS FOUND; ONLY THE SMELL OF ELECTRICAL SMOKE WAS EVIDENT. MAINT THEN REINSTATED THE ELECTRICAL BUSSES THAT WERE ISOLATED. AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES; IT WAS FOUND THE #1 OVEN HAD APPARENTLY HEATED TO AN ABNORMALLY HIGH TEMP PRODUCING SMOKE THAT VENTED TO THE OVERHEAD AND WAS ESCAPING OVER THE 1L DOOR. THIS LED THE FLT ATTENDANT TO BELIEVE SHE HAD A PROB IN OVERHEAD CEILING RATHER THAN THE OVEN. THE #1 OVEN FORWARD GALLEY CIRCUIT BREAKER HAD APPARENTLY NEVER POPPED; AND ACCORDING TO MAINT IT WAS EXTREMELY HOT AND SHOULD HAVE. AFTER MAINT REMOVED THE OVERHEAD PANELS AND DETERMINED THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THAT AREA AND THE AREA AROUND THE OVEN; THEY PLACARDED THE OVEN; SIGNED THE LOGBOOK FOR THE OVERWEIGHT LNDG; ETOPS INSPECTION; AND RELEASED THE ACFT FOR FLT.THE FLT CONTINUED TO ZZZZ2 WITH NO FURTHER INCIDENCE.

ZME 'FEEDS' ENRTE ACFT INTO MEM APCH AIRSPACE VIA THE '4 CORNERPOST' SYS. ON A DAILY BASIS AND 'ANYTIME' HVY ACFT ARE INVOLVED; ANY OF THE 4 SECTORS WILL 'DRIVE' TRAILING ACFT INTO A 'LESS THAN REQUIRED' WAKE TURB IN-TRAIL SEPARATION SIT BEHIND A HVY JET. THIS ALSO HAPPENS WITH LARGE JET ACFT. THIS 'TECHNIQUE' USED BY ZME IS THEIR METHOD OF 'STANDARD IN-TRAIL' SEPARATION. ZME WILL INSTRUCT JET AND PROP ACFT TO 'GO FAST' AS THEY'RE ENTERING APCH AIRSPACE. THIS IS A USELESS TECHNIQUE BECAUSE THE ACFT MUST SLOW DOWN AND START THE DSCNT AND RADAR VECTORS FOR REQUIRED RADAR SPACING FROM APCH TO THE FINAL CTL POS. ZME WILL INSTRUCT JET AND HVY JET ACFT TO 'RESUME NORMAL SPD' JUST AS THEIR RADIO FREQS ARE CHANGED TO MEM APCH CTL. THE HVY JETS WILL SLOW DOWN RAPIDLY ON THEIR OWN; ESPECIALLY ON THE 'SHORT SIDE' OR BASE LEG FEED TO THE FINAL CTLRS. EVERY HVY JET PLT HAS TOLD ME THAT TO SLOW DOWN AND DSND IS VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. THIS IS THE CASE WITH ACR X HVY DC10/MD11'S. IT IS COMMON FOR ZME TO 'FORCE FEED' MEM APCH SEVERAL JETS IN-TRAIL OF A HVY AND HAVE THE TRAILING JETS GO FAST. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE STAR TRANSITIONS FEED INTO THE ARR GATES ZME USES 'GO FAST' SPDS KNOWING THAT AS SOON AS THE ACFT CROSSES THE 40 NM 'XFER OF CTL POINT' APCH WILL DSND THE ARR ACFT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THE SHORT SIDE/BASE LEG FEED. THIS CAUSES THE USUAL 10 NM JET IN-TRAIL SPACING TO DECREASE TO MINIMUM RADAR SEPARATION. THIS BECOMES EVEN MORE UNSATISFACTORY FOR JET ACFT OPERATING BEHIND A HVY JET. THE STARS SHOULD BE REWORKED TO ESTABLISH 'ONE' IN-TRAIL FEED AS THEY ENTER MEM AIRSPACE/XING THE XFER OF CTL POINT. ZME THINKS NOTHING ABOUT GIVING MEM APCH OF 'CUT OFF' WITH JET ACFT AS THEY ENTER OUR AIRSPACE. ZME CONTINUES TO ONLY SWITCH ACFT FREQS TO MEM AS 'THEY CROSS THE XFER OF CTL POINT.' THIS LACK OF RESPECT AND VIOLATION OF THE FAA HANDBOOK 7110.65 WHICH REQUIRES ACFT TO BE ON THE NEXT FACILITY'S FREQS BEFORE THEY ENTER THE NEXT AIRSPACE ONLY ENSURES TO 'PROTECT' THEMSELVES FROM A POSSIBLE ERROR.

ONCE I QUIT TRYING TO GET THE AUTOPLT TO BAIL ME OUT AND I WAS ABLE TO GET THE GPS TO DO WHAT I WANTED I WAS ABLE TO FIND MY IAF AND FLY THE APCH. THE CAUSE OF THIS EVENT WAS DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS: 1) I DID NOT ANTICIPATE THE WX BEING SO BAD. 2) I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE GPS IN THE ACFT. 3) I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE AUTOPLT IN THE ACFT. 4) THIS WAS MY FIRST FLT INTO IMC AND MYSELF AS THE ONLY PLT. I LEARNED SEVERAL VALUABLE LESSONS FROM THIS EXPERIENCE: 1) I SHOULD HAVE FILED AN ALTERNATE; THE FORECASTS ARE NOT ALWAYS PERFECT. 2) KNOW THE EQUIP THAT YOU WILL BE USING; NOTHING IS WORSE THAN BEING IN A BAD SIT AND NOT KNOWING HOW TO USE THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO YOU TO RESOLVE THE PROB. 3) ACTUAL IMC IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN SIMULATED IMC USING THE FOGGLES.

AFTER TKOF; I DID A SHALLOW TURN TO THE W (AWAY FROM THE MOUNTAINS); WITH THE GOAL TO CIRCLE OVER THE ARPT IN ORDER TO GAIN ALT OVER WHAT I MEMORIZED AS THE SAFETY ZONE (CIRCLE OF ABOUT 3 MI OF DIAMETER W OF LXV). WHAT SURPRISED ME RIGHT AFTER MY FIRST L TURN WAS; ALTHOUGH I SAW THE STARS OVER ME; I COULD NOT AT ALL SEE THE RANGE OF MOUNTAINS W OF LEADVILLE. MY FIRST REACTION WAS TO DIMINISH THE LIGHTS INSIDE THE AIRPLANE. AND I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS JUST THE LIGHT IN THE AIRPLANE THAT DIMINISHED MY ABILITY TO SEE OUTSIDE; AND THAT AFTER A FEW MINS MY EYES WOULD ADAPT TO IT. RIGHT AFTER DIMMING THE LIGHT; I RESUMED MY CIRCLING; FOCUSING AT GETTING THE BEST RATE OF CLB WHILE CIRCLING IN THE 'SAFETY ZONE.' IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN MY POS; I USED THE ARPT'S LIGHTS AND THE LIGHTS OF LEADVILLE. WHEN PASSING ABOUT 13000 FT; I PROGRESSIVELY LOST CONTACT WITH THE GND LIGHT DUE TO CLOUDS IN BTWN ME AND GND. THIS TIME I GOT SCARED; BECAUSE AFTER CHKING IN ALL DIRECTIONS; I WAS UNABLE TO SEE MOUNTAIN OR CLOUDS (ALTHOUGH I WAS ABLE TO SEE THE STARS ABOVE ME). AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO TELL IF IT WAS CLOUDS OR JUST THE LACK OF LIGHT THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH THE HORIZON IN FRONT OF ME (THE RANGE OF MOUNTAINS AROUND LXV TOP AT 14000 FT). I THOUGHT OF GOING BACK TO LXV; BUT I GOT SCARED TO GET INTO THE CLOUDS AND GET IN EVEN WORSE SIT THAN I ALREADY WAS. SO I DECIDED TO CONTINUE MY CIRCLING CLB AND KEPT TRACK OF MY GND POS WITH THE HELP OF THE GPS. MY FIRST GOAL WAS TO ENSURE THAT I WOULD STAY CLR OF CLOUDS. BUT WITHOUT ANY REF EXCEPT THE SKY ABOVE ME; I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA UP TO WHICH ALT TO GO. THINKING ABOUT THE WX CONDITION (FROM MY FLT IN; AND THE ASOS RPT); I HOPED THAT THE CLOUDS WERE ONLY ON THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE. AND AT ABOUT 17500 FT; I TURNED EASTWARD. I WAS EXPECTING TO SEE THE LIGHTS OF FAIRPLAY AFTER ABOUT 5 MINS. BUT NOT SEEING THEM DID RAISE MY WORRIES. BECAUSE THAT MEANT THAT THERE WERE STILL CLOUDS IN FRONT OF ME (I THOUGHT). I KNEW I WAS ALREADY WAY TOO HIGH TO FLY WITHOUT OXYGEN. BUT IN A LAST EFFORT I CLBED TO AROUND FL190 WHERE I WAS ALMOST POSITIVE THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABOVE THE CLOUDS. I KNEW I WAS IN CLASS A AIRSPACE; BUT I DIDN'T SEE ANY OTHER OPTION AT THIS TIME OF THE FLT. MY XPONDER WAS ON 'ALT' WITH CODE 1200 AND I WAS HOPING THAT ZDV HAD ME ON THEIR RADAR FOR TFC AVOIDANCE. I FINALLY SAW FAIRPLAY AFTER ABOUT A MIN. BUT KNOWING THE TIME WAS AGAINST ME AT THIS ALT; I DID TRY TO GO DOWN AFTER PASSING FAIRPLAY (WHICH GUARANTEED ME THAT I WAS CLR OF THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE). BUT EXCEPT FOR THE LIGHTS OF DENVER; I WAS STILL NOT ABLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING. SO I DID TRY TO GO PROGRESSIVELY DOWN TO 14000 FT AND I ONLY DID MY DSCNT TO REASONABLE ALT AFTER PASSING EVERGREEN; CO (JUST W OF THE DENVER FOOTHILLS). THEN I FLEW ALONG THE EAST FOOTHILLS (ABOVE THE CITY LIGHTS) UP TO MY RPT POINT (CHATFIELD RESERVOIR) FOR MY FIRST CALL TO APA. TO MY SURPRISE; I WASN'T ABLE TO SEE THE RESERVOIR WHEN I WAS ABOVE IT. ANYWAY; RECOGNIZING THE PLACE BY THE STREET POS; I CALLED APA AND DID FINISH MY FLT UNEVENTFULLY. I NEED TO SAY THAT THIS WAS MY FIRST AND I HOPE LAST FLT IN SUCH EXTREME CONDITIONS. I FAILED TO CHK THE MOON RISE TIME. ALTHOUGH I'VE ABOUT 100 HRS NIGHT FLYING (MOST WHILE TRAINING FOR IFR). I DISCOVERED THAT MY KNOWLEDGE OF NIGHT FLYING WAS VERY LITTLE BECAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT SUCH DARKNESS. AND WHAT SCARED ME THE MOST WAS THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO SEE THE CLOUDS. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO NOT SEE WHITE CLOUDS? THIS REALLY SCARED ME THE MOST. WHEN I WAS IN CLASS A AIRSPACE; I MAY HAVE BEEN WELL CLR OF CLOUDS. BUT I COULD NOT TELL YOU IF THIS WAS THE CASE OR NOT. BECAUSE THE ONLY THING I SAW WAS BLACK -- WITH SOME STARS ABOVE IT. LIST OF MISTAKES: 1) THE OVERCONFIDENCE IN MY NIGHT FLYING SKILL. 2) NOT TO CHK WHEN THE MOON WAS VISIBLE AND AT WHICH HT OVER THE HORIZON. 3) THE MAIN MISTAKE -- THE LACK OF ANALYSIS OF THE SIT AFTER TKOF. BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME I COULD HAVE COME BACK SAFELY TO LXV. AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THE LACK OF SKY LIGHT WAS GOING TO MAKE THE FLT IMPOSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN IN SAFE CONDITIONS. AFTER ANALYZING ALL THE STEPS OF THE FLT; THIS WAS THE ONLY ONE WHERE I COULD HAVE ABORTED SAFELY. 4) AFTER LOSING SIGHT CONTACT WITH LXV; I SHOULD HAVE LEVELED OFF IN CIRCLE OVER LXV WITH THE HELP OF THE GPS AND CONTACT FSS OR ZDV OVER THE RADIO TO ASK FOR HELP. I DIDN'T DO THAT FOR 1 STUPID REASON -- I WAS SCARED TO GET YELLED AT AND LOSE THE LAST BIT OF CTL I HAD ON MY INTERNAL PANIC LEVEL. I KNOW THAT MAY BE SURPRISING; BUT I USED A LOT OF ENERGY TO KEEP MY STRESS DOWN. 5) GOING AT SUCH HT WITHOUT OXYGEN. IF I WOULD HAVE CONTACTED FSS OF ZDV; I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PARTIALLY AVOID THIS. I SAY PARTIALLY BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE HAD TO FLY AT LEVEL WHERE OXYGEN IS NEEDED TO CONTACT ZDV. 6) ENTERING CLASS A AIRSPACE. I MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FLY BELOW IT. BUT I CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT. MY WORRY WAS TO STAY OUT OF THE CLOUDS. I KNEW THAT IF I WAS OUT OF THE CLOUDS I HAD LESS CHANCE TO LOSE CTL OF THE ACFT. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY; I COULD BE SEEN AND I COULD SEE OTHER TFC. I DID TRY TO DO THE BEST AT THE TIME. BUT FOR SURE; IF IT HAPPENS TO ME AGAIN; I WOULD NOT DO THE SAME THING. I WOULD JUST NOT FLY AND GO TO THE HOTEL AND WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING. BUT MOST PROBABLY IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN BECAUSE FROM THIS EXPERIENCE; I THINK IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FLY AT NIGHT OVER MOUNTAINS IN VFR -- EVEN IF YOU HAVE LCL KNOWLEDGE. LAST BUT NOT LEAST; I FAILED TO MAINTAIN MY MINIMUM PERSONAL SAFETY REQUIREMENT FOR A VFR FLT: HAVING AT ANY GIVEN TIME OF THE FLT AT LEAST 2 ESCAPE RTES READY TO BE USED.",,,,"C182 PLT DEPARTS LXV AND CLBS INTO CLASS A AIRSPACE WHEN DARKNESS AND CLOUDS DISRUPT PLANNED VFR RTE THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS.",

IN RECYCLING THE PITOT HEAT ROCKER SWITCH; THE PITOT HEAT DID COME BACK ON AND THE AIRSPD INDICATOR DID START TO WORK AGAIN. I DID NOT DECLARE AN EMER TO ATC SINCE I WAS EVALUATING THE PROB AND BELIEVED IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE WHAT EXACTLY THE SIT WAS. BY THE TIME I RESOLVED THE PROB; THERE WAS NO EMER TO DECLARE; ONLY THE LOSS OF ALT TO RPT. HUMAN FACTORS: USING THE AVIATE; NAV; COMMUNICATE PRIORITY; I BELIEVE MY ACTIONS WERE REASONABLE. I FOCUSED ON MAINTAINING CTL OF THE ACFT AND RESOLVING THE PROB. ONCE THAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED; I RPTED THE ALT LOSS TO ATC. PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE INFORMED THEM OF THE TEMPORARY LOSS OF AIRSPD AND THE SUBSEQUENT RETURN OF THE AIRSPD INDICATOR. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATED THAT UPON CONTACTING MINNEAPOLIS APCH; SHE WAS GIVEN A PHONE NUMBER TO CALL UPON LNDG. THE SUBSEQUENT CALL TO CTR WAS CORDIAL AND THEY UNDERSTOOD HER SIT. THE ONLY COMMENT FROM THE CTLR WAS IF SHE NEEDED SPECIAL HANDLING AN EMER DECLARATION WOULD GET HER AID. SHE WAS GIVING INST INSTRUCTION AT THE TIME AND ALTHOUGH FLYING IN ICING WAS NOT IDEAL; SHE ALSO FLIES CHARTER IN THE C340 AND C402 AND IS FAMILIAR WITH ICING CONDITIONS. THE SIT IN WHICH SHE FOUND HER INST STUDENT WAS NOT SERIOUS ENOUGH TO WARRANT IMMEDIATE ACTION.

FOR EXAMPLE; ON ONE ACFT; THE TOUCH WHEEL CTL STEERING SWITCH IS IN THE SAME PLACE AS THE PTT ON ANOTHER ACFT; WHICH IS THE FD COMMAND BAR SYNCH ON A THIRD ACFT. THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. THE INDUSTRY MUST STANDARDIZE ALL CTL WHEEL SWITCHES! USING DIFFERENT COLORS IS NOT ENOUGH! DIFFERENT SHAPE SWITCHES NEED TO BE USED. THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS DONE YEARS AGO WITH PROP/MIXTURE/THROTTLE/LNDG GEAR/FLAP CTLS. THAT WAY THE PLT HAS INSTANT TACTILE FEEDBACK ON PROPER SWITCH ACTIVATION.

ON DEP THE HIGHEST ALT I SAW WAS 1620 FT APPROX 120 FT HIGH. ON TUE/APR/05 I FLEW THE SAME DEP AND USED A NORMAL RATE OF CLB APPROX 1000-1500 FT/MIN FOR A SMOOTH TRANSITION. WHEN WE CONTACTED NY DEP THEY WERE ANXIOUS FOR US TO START OUR R TURN; I BELIEVE TO AVOID NEWARK AIRSPACE. WITH THIS IN MIND AND FROM PAST RWY 24 DEPS WITH SIMILAR CALLS FROM DEP I DECIDED TO CLB QUICKER; APPROX 2000FT/MIN; TO REACH MY LEVELOFF AND TURN SOONER. AS I PASSED 1200 FT I REDUCED POWER SELECTED HDG ON MY FD RECHKED MY ALT SELECTOR SET AT 1500 FT AND ALT SELECT WAS THE ACTIVE MODE ON THE FD. MY COMMAND BARS WERE STILL SHOWING CLB INDICATIONS AS I PASSED APPROX 1400 FT. I REALIZED MY FD DID NOT CAPTURE THE ALT AND I STARTED TO LEVEL OFF BUT COULD NOT STOP AT 1500 FT. NY DEP CALLED AND TOLD US TO DSND ALTHOUGH WE HAD ALREADY INITIATED THE DSCNT. THE DEP CTLR WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND REMINDED US HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO LEVEL AT 1500 FT BECAUSE OF NEWARK'S ARR CORRIDOR OVERHEAD. HE TOLD US THERE WAS NO OTHER TFC OR CONFLICT; AND REMINDED US TO BE EXTRA DILIGENT IN THE FUTURE. I BELIEVE THE MAIN CAUSE OF THIS DEV WAS MY INCREASED CLB RATE. MY NORMAL ROUTINE FOR POWER REDUCTION AND RELEASE OF BACK PRESSURE NEEDED TO BE STARTED SOONER. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE MY ATTEMPT TO ANTICIPATE NY DEP WANTING US TO EXPEDITE THE CLB TO 1500 FT; THE FD NOT CAPTURING THE ALT AND THE MOMENTARY DISTRACTION OF SETTING MY FD/CREW RESOURCE MGMNT TO HDG BEFORE WE LEVELED OFF. THE DEP WAS THOROUGHLY BRIEFED; THE FLT MGMNT SYSTEM (FMS) AND FD WERE SET FOR TKOF. IN THE FUTURE I INTENDED TO USE MY NORMAL RATE OF CLB AND MAKE SURE THE FD HAS CAPTURED THE ALT BEFORE I START CONSIDERING THE TURN. FROM A CREW RESOURCE MGMNT STANDPOINT I WILL HAVE THE CO-PLT SELECT THE FD HDG MODE SO I CAN CONCENTRATE ON THE DEP. NORMALLY THE CO-PLT HAS A VERY HIGH WORKLOAD ON THIS DEP AND THEREFORE; I CHOSE TO SET MY FD MYSELF. IN THE PAST 5 YRS I HAVE PERSONALLY FLOWN THIS DEP IN THE ACFT AND THE SIMULATOR DOZENS OF TIMES WITHOUT INCIDENT AND BELIEVE THIS TO BE AN ANOMALY.

THE FOLLOWING LEG FROM TEB TO PSM WAS FLOWN BY ANOTHER PLT AND I MOVED FROM PF IN L SEAT TO PNF IN THE R SEAT. IT WAS MY JOB TO PREPARE THE AIRPLANE FOR DEP.

ON DSCNT INTO ZZZ2 ON ARR; FUEL LOW LEVEL LIGHTS ILLUMINATED; ALERTING CREW TO 800 LBS REMAINING ONBOARD. FUEL DISCREPANCY WAS REALIZED. CREW DECLARED EMER AND DIVERTED TO ZZZ3. THE EMER CHKLIST WAS EXECUTED AND THE FLT LANDED WITHOUT FURTHER ASSISTANCE AT ZZZ3. I BELIEVE THIS PROB WAS CAUSED FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. FIRST WAS CREW FATIGUE. THIS WAS DAY SEVEN OF A SEVEN DAY TRIP. TOTAL DUTY UP UNTIL THIS POINT WAS 73 HOURS OUT OF A POSSIBLE 84 HOURS. THIS TRIP SEQUENCE HAD SOME VERY LONG DAYS WITH A VERY SHORT REST TIME. AS LITTLE AS 10 HOURS ON TWO OF THE DAYS. SECOND CAUSE WAS POSITION OF FUEL QUANTITY CHECK ON THE CHKLIST. THIS SHOULD BE PLACED ON THE BEFORE START CHKLIST. BEFORE THE ACFT IS MOVING. GIVING BOTH PLTS A CHANCE TO VERIFY FUEL ONBOARD. THIRD CAUSE WAS DEMANDS TO MAKE SCHEDULE WITH PERCEIVED REPERCUSSIONS BY THE CREW FROM THE COMPANY. EARLY IN THE WEEK; THE CREW WAS QUESTIONED BY THE COMPANY FOR A ONE MINUTE DELAY. PLTS BEING DISCIPLINED FOR FAILURE TO MEET SCHEDULE. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 656172: THE FOLLOWING TABLE REFLECTS START TIME AND DUTY TIMES FOR THE TOUR. 4/SUN/05; XA:00-XI:12; 9 HOURS 12 MINS. 4/MON/05; XZ:00-XL:00; 13 HOURS. 4/TUE/05; XY:00-XL:00; 14 HOURS. 4/WED/05; XE:00-X3:06; 10 HOURS; 6 MINS. 4/THU/05; XX:00-XT:34; 12 HOURS; 34 MINS. 4/FRI/05; XW:00-XH:54; 12 HOURS 54 MINS. 4/SAT/05; XY:54. THIS HAPPENED ON THE 7TH DAY OF EARLY DUTY STARTS ON MY BIOLOGICAL CLOCK AND FATIGUE WAS A FACTOR. WE HAD A PROB WITH THE FUEL BILL AND HAD TO GET IT RE-DONE. WHEN WE GOT TO THE ACFT; WE WERE DISTRACTED BY AN INABILITY TO CONTACT ATC FOR OUR CLRNC. BEING IN A HURRY; I MISREAD THE FUEL GAUGES. WE WERE ALSO PRE-OCCUPIED WITH DISCUSSING HOW TO SAFELY GET OUR CLRNC AIRBORNE. ALTHOUGH OUR DUTY TIMES FELL WITHIN LEGAL LIMITS; THE LONG DAYS AND EARLY STARTS CONTRIBUTED TO FATIGUE.

BOTH FROM ZME. ONE FROM THE JBR LOW; AND ONE FROM THE HEE LOW SECTORS. IN BOTH SITUATIONS; I HAD TO TAKE ACTION TO PREVENT A LOSS OF REQUIRED MINIMUM RADAR IN-TRAIL SEPARATION BTWN A HVY JET AND A TRAILING REGIONAL JET. THE FIRST INVOLVED A SITUATION WITH ACFT ON A STAR OVER THE GQE VOR/DME FACILITY. THE TRAILING CRJ ACFT WAS NOT PROVIDED 10 MI IN-TRAIL SEPARATION AT THE TIME THE LEADING OR TRAILING ACFT CROSSED THE MEM APCH 40 NM TCP. I TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION TO REDUCE THE CRJ'S SPD TO MAINTAIN 'MINIMUM' WAKE TURB SEPARATION. I DID NOT DSND THE LEADING HVY JET UNTIL I HAD MORE THAN THE MINIMUM RADAR IN-TRAIL SEPARATION. NOR DID I REDUCE THE HVY JET'S AIRSPD. THIS HAPPENS EVERY DAY AND ALL DAY LONG BY ZME. THE SECOND SITUATION INVOLVED THE HEE LOW SECTOR 'FEEDING' ACFT OVER THE UJM VOR/DME FACILITY. THIS FEED IS WHAT WE CALL THE SHORT SIDE OF BASE LEG SIDE. THESE MUST BE ISSUED AN IMMEDIATE RADAR VECTOR AND SPD CTL TO OBTAIN REQUIRED SPACING TO THE FINAL CTLR WHO WORKS RWY 36L IN THIS CASE. THE LEADING ACFT WAS AGAIN A HVY DC10 FOLLOWED BY A REGIONAL JET. I HAD NOT DSNDED THE HVY JET AND I DID NOT ACCEPT THE RADAR HDOF FROM THE ZME CTLR ON THE TRAILING E145. THE E145 WAS LESS THAN 10 MI IN TRAIL AND 90 KTS FASTER AND AT THE SAME ALT OF 10000 FT MSL. I HAD THE COORDINATOR CALL THE HEE SECTOR AND TEL THEM I WASN'T TAKING THIS LOSS OF SEPARATION HDOF. ZME JUST SLOWED THE ACFT TO 250 KTS. I TOOK THE HDOF KNOWING I COULD RADAR THE HVY OUT OF THE WAY OF THE E145. I JUST BARELY KEPT THE REQUIRED MINIMUM WAKE TURB SEPARATION BTWN THE HVY AND THE E145. THIS SITUATION WAS OVER THE TOP OF AN SF34 AT 8000 FT MSL WHICH IS A 'STANDARD' FEED FROM ZME. THIS TYPE OF FEED IS THE USUAL FEED THAT WE RECEIVE FROM ZME. IT IS NOT AN UNUSUAL SITUATION. I REGARD THIS TYPE OF 'TECHNIQUE' TO BE VERY POOR AND MEM APCH SAVES THESE TYPE OF SITUATIONS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. I AM OF THE OPINION THAT ZME PLAYS GAMES OR ALL OF THE CENTRAL AREA CTLRS USE VERY POOR TECHNIQUES TO FEED ACFT INTO THE BUSY MEM TERMINAL AIRSPACE. THERE ARE OTHER TECHNIQUES THEY USE. HAVING THE LEADING JET ACFT GO FAST UNTIL THE ACFT REACHES TO 40 NM TCP AND THEN MEM HAS TO SLOW THE ACFT AND DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION. THE REVERSE TECHNIQUE SHOULD BE USED. SLOW THE TRAILING ACFT DOWN TO MATCH THE LEADING ACFT SPD. IF ZME CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS; THEN MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO HAVE ALL JET ACFT CROSS THE TCP 'AT' 250 KTS.",,,,"MEM APCH CTLR EXPRESSED CONCERN REGARDING ZME CTLR'S TECHNIQUE DURING ARR FEED FOR MEM ARPT WHICH REQUIRED HVY ACFT SEPARATION.",

THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED CASE; IN REF TO THIS INSPECTION. I FAIL TO SEE THE REASON FOR THIS SCENARIO; AND I ALSO ASKED THE ENGINEER WHY; IF WE DON'T TRUST THE INSPECTION DEPT IN ZZZ1 OR ANY OTHER STATION TO DO THIS; WHY BOTHER HAVING IT SCHEDULED SO?

I HAVE FLOWN GENERAL AVIATION FIXED WING; HELI; GLIDERS; ULTRA LIGHTS; AND SEAPLANES; WAS A MIL FLT INSTRUCTOR AND HEAVY FIXED WING PLT. I HAD A FULL CAREER AS AN ACR LINE PLT; INSTRUCTOR AND LINE CHK PLT. WHAT I AM ABOUT TO DESCRIBE SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED...TO ME; OF ALL PEOPLE! MAYBE MY 'EXPERIENCE' CONTRIBUTED TO MY EXTREME STUPIDITY IN THIS SCENARIO. I FLEW FROM HOME BASE TO DEST ARPT SEVERAL HUNDRED MI AWAY THE DAY AFTER INCLEMENT WX HAD PASSED THROUGH THE AREA. FORECASTS WERE PREDICTING HIGH PRESSURE ALONG MY RTE OF FLT; INCLUDING MY RETURN THREE DAYS LATER. WX WAS FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE MIDWEST THE EVENING AFTER MY PLANNED MORNING TKOF FOR RETURN TO HOME BASE. WX WAS CLR ALONG THE ENTIRE RTE OF FLT; AS RPTED AND FORECAST. CONTRARY THE FORECAST HOWEVER; IT RAINED FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS! I DELAYED MY RETURN FOR ONE DAY; AWOKE TO CLR SKIES WITH FORECAST AT HOME BASE FOR EARLY MORNING THUNDERSTORMS; MOVING TO THE E OF THE AREA BY MY PLANNED ARR FROM THE W...SHOULD BE A GOOD DAY FOR FLYING! AFTER AN ENRTE FUEL STOP; AND ABOUT HALF WAY TO HOME BASE; I ENCOUNTERED LOWERING CEILINGS. I LANDED TO TAKE A LOOK AT WX WITH AWOS RPTING 1200-1500 FT BROKEN AND 7 MI VISIBILITY. I CHKED THE WX AND CONSIDERED FILING IFR; HOWEVER REVISED SIGMETS NOW INDICATED CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY IMBEDDED IN CLOUDS WITH HIGH TOPS; HIGH WINDS AND HAIL...NOT CONDUCIVE TO NO-ONBOARD-RADAR IFR. I WAITED FOR OVER AN HOUR AND HAD LUNCH WHILE WATCHING LOCAL CONDITIONS AND TO SEE IF ENRTE WX WAS IN FACT DEVELOPED AS FORECAST. AFTER RETURNING FROM LUNCH; THE CEILING AND VISIBILITY APPEARED TO HAVE IMPROVED AND WAS VERIFIED BY AWOS. I DEPARTED; OPTIMISTIC THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE VFR BENEATH THE CEILING TO HOME BASE. AWOS RPTS ALONG EITHER SIDE OF MY INTENDED RTE SUPPORTED THIS DECISION; EVEN THOUGH FORECAST CONDITIONS WERE FOR MARGINAL VFR. I HADN'T GOTTEN VERY FAR WHEN; ONCE MORE; THE CEILING DROPPED BELOW MY COMFORT LEVEL IN MARGINAL VFR CONDITIONS. I WAS FACING A RIDGELINE AND SOME HIGHER TERRAIN AHEAD AND WAS BEGINNING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO SAFELY CLR THE RIDGE; MUCH LESS MAINTAIN VFR. AN AWOS JUST SHORT OF THE RIDGE LINE WAS STILL RPTING VFR CONDITIONS; HOWEVER. ONCE MORE; I LANDED AT AN ARPT OF OPPORTUNITY; CALLED 1-800-WXBRIEF AND AGAIN RECEIVED THE MARGINAL VFR FORECAST. THERE WERE SOME AWOS STATIONS RPTING IFR CEILINGS; HOWEVER ARPTS DIRECTLY ALONG MY INTENDED RTE WERE RPTING 1200 FT CEILING WITH 4-10 MI VISIBILITY. AFTER ABOUT 30 MINS ON THE GND; I LEFT ONCE MORE; THINKING THAT THE LOWER LOCAL CEILINGS THAT I WAS EXPERIENCING WOULD IMPROVE 'A FEW MI' ALONG MY PLANNED TRACK. AFTER FLYING A FEW MORE MILES; AGAIN; CONDITIONS JUST WERE NOT WHAT I WAS HEARING ON AWOS. CONDITIONS CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE AND I WAS FORCED TO DSND BELOW 1000 FT AGL TO REMAIN CLR OF CLOUDS. THE VISIBILITY WAS ACCEPTABLE; BUT NOT OPTIMAL. I PASSED DIRECTLY ABEAM AN ARPT THAT WAS RPTING 1200 FT OVERCAST AND EITHER 4 OR 6 MILES VISIBILITY. I CONSIDERED LNDG; HOWEVER; AS LONG AS I HAD LEGAL VFR; I ELECTED TO CONTINUE. BIG MISTAKE! ABOUT 25 MI FURTHER ALONG; THE CEILING CAME DOWN AND I WAS EXPERIENCING INTERMITTENT LIGHT RAIN. EVEN THOUGH I WAS STILL HEARING AWOS RPTS OF VFR CEILINGS AND VISIBILITIES AHEAD; I WAS RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS FOR REMAINING VFR. THERE WERE NO ARPTS AVAILABLE AT THAT POINT THAT DIDN'T HAVE EVEN LOWER CLOUDS VISIBLE IN THEIR DIRECTION. MY CHOICES AT THIS POINT WERE TO CONTINUE AT VERY LOW ALT CLR OF CLOUDS; ENTER THE OVERCAST WITHOUT CLRNC AND TRY TO GET ATC ASSISTANCE; OR LAND ON A HWY. I ELECTED TO CONTINUE AT LOW ALT. FINALLY; 25 MI FROM HOME BASE; THE CEILING AND VISIBILITY IMPROVED TO 2000 FT PLUS AND 10MI; SO I MADE IT HOME. I; OF ALL PEOPLE; KNOW BETTER! CONTINUING FLT INTO MARGINAL VFR CONDITIONS IS A CLASSIC CAUSE OF AVIATION TRAGEDIES. I WAS SO CONVINCED; BASED ON REAL-TIME AWOS XMISSIONS THAT I WOULD FIND IMPROVING CONDITIONS IF I WENT 'JUST A LITTLE BIG FURTHER.' MINE WAS A CLASSIC CASE OF BAD JUDGEMENT. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT I SHOULD HAVE SHUT DOWN THE FLT AFTER THE FIRST LNDG WHEN I HAD LUNCH. IF I HAD PARKED THE AIRPLANE; GONE TO A MOTEL AND CONTINUED TO HOME BASE THE NEXT DAY; I WOULD HAVE HAD CLR SKIES AND MANY MILES VISIBILITY. INSTEAD; OVERCONFIDENCE; PROBABLY DUE IN PART TO OPTIMISM FED BY RPTED WX THAT WAS BETTER THAN I CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE; LED ME INTO A SIT THAT WAS UNSAFE; IN VIOLATION OF FARS AND CONTRARY TO MY PERSONAL RULES OF FLT MGMNT. MY BEST ADVICE; WHICH SHOULD BE BASIC; COMMON SENSE: DONT PUSH IT WHEN IT COMES TO MARGINAL WX.",,,,"A VFR C185 PLT ENCOUNTERED IMC AND CONTINUED AT A LOW AGL ALT FINALLY CLRING WX TO LAND VMC AT HIS HOME BASE.",

I WAS THE PF AND THE FO WAS THE PNF (FO WAS HANDLING THE RADIOS). DURING THE CLB PHASE; WE WERE CLRED TO AN ALT OF FL450 AND WERE ON VECTORS FROM ATC. AFTER PASSING THROUGH FL350; THE L ENG COMPRESSOR STALLED. UP UNTIL THE COMPRESSOR STALL; THE ENG HAD GOOD INDICATIONS AND WAS PERFORMING NORMALLY. WE WERE MAINTAINING AN AIRSPD OF .74 MACH AND THE OUTSIDE AIR TEMP WAS -20 DEGS C AT THE TIME OF THE COMPRESSOR STALL. AFTER TRYING TO MAINTAIN ALT; IT WAS APPARENT TO ME THAT WE WOULD BE UNABLE TO. AT THIS POINT THE AIRSPD WAS DECREASING. IN FEAR OF STALLING THE ACFT AND WORSENING THE SIT; WE BEGAN A DSCNT FROM FL350. I TURNED THE ACFT DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE ARPT AS A PRECAUTION. I INSTRUCTED MY FO TO DECLARE AN EMER; AN INSTRUCTION IN WHICH HE DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE NOR EXECUTE. MY FO BEGAN TO ARGUE ABOUT THE SIT AND MY DECISION TO TELL ATC ABOUT THE EMER. TO FURTHER COMPLICATE THINGS; MY FO BEGAN TO ARGUE WITH ATC. AFTER REPEATED ATTEMPTS BY ATC TO FIND OUT WHAT OUR PROB WAS; I FINALLY CONVINCED THE FO; IN NAME OF SAFETY; TO DECLARE AN EMER. ATC ACKNOWLEDGED OUR EMER; CLRED US DIRECT TO THE ARPT AND GAVE US A LOWER ALT. AFTER WE DSNDED THROUGH FL250; THE ENG WAS RESTARTED. WE NOTIFIED ATC THAT THE SIT WAS UNDER CTL AND WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE OUR DSCNT AND LAND. THE LNDG WAS SAFE AND UNEVENTFUL. AFTER LNDG; I RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE FBO TO CALL THE CTR SUPVR; IN WHICH I DID IMMEDIATELY. DURING OUR CONVERSATION; THE SUPVR HAD QUESTIONS REGARDING WHY WE DEVIATED FROM HDG AND ALT. HE ALSO QUESTIONED WHY WE HAD NOT DECLARED AN EMER IMMEDIATELY.

I EXPLAINED OUR SIDE OF THE STORY HOPING TO MAKE IT CLR THAT WE DID INDEED HAD AN EMER. HE SAID HE WOULD REVIEW THE TAPES AND CALL ME.

BEFORE THE FLT; I GENERATED AND CONSULTED AN ON-LINE DUAT STANDARD AREA BRIEFING TO VERIFY; AMONG OTHER THINGS; THE WX CONDITIONS; THE WX FORECAST; TFRS AND NOTAMS. CONDITIONS WERE GOOD AND THERE WAS NOTHING SPECIFICALLY ISSUED FOR THE AREA. AS I WAS ON MY WAY TO LEAVE THE CORRIDOR AND RETURN TO MY HOME AIRFIELD; A FELLOW HELI PLT INFORMED ME (THROUGH THE SPECIAL SELF-ANNOUNCE FREQ) THAT I WAS VIOLATING THE STADIUM TFR. I LOOKED ON MY CHARTS (NY SECTIONAL AND NY VFR TERMINAL AREA) TO LOCATE THE STADIUM AND EVALUATE THE TFR. THIS STADIUM IS NOT INDICATED ON EITHER CHARTS. I THEN DECIDED TO CONTACT LA GUARDIA TWR TO ADVISE THEM OF MY PRESENCE AND IDENTIFICATION. THEY ADVISED ME TO CONTACT THEM ON A DIFFERENT FREQ. BY THEN; I ESTIMATED I WAS MOST LIKELY OUTSIDE OF THE TFR. A FEW MINUTES LATER; I CONTACTED NY APCH TO COMPLETE MY FLT; ADVISING THEM THAT I WAS INBND TO MY HOME AIRFIELD. BACK ON THE GND; I CHKED THE FAA WEB SITE FOR THE GRAPHICAL TFRS. THE STADIUM TFR IS NOT REPRESENTED. THE ONLY WAY I WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT I HAD VIOLATED A TFR WAS TO LOCATE THE STADIUM ON A ROAD ATLAS AND CHK THE TEAM'S WEB SITE TO CONFIRM THAT THEY HAD BEEN PLAYING AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME. A FOLLOWING PHONE CALL TO THE FAA PHONE NUMBER LISTED IN THE GENERIC FDC NOTAM CONFIRMED THAT NO INFO WAS AVAILABLE FROM THE FAA. FROM THIS EXPERIENCE; IT IS CLEAR THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR A PLT TO COMPLY WITH STADIUM TFRS AS THE AIRMAN INFO DISTRIBUTED DOES NOT PROVIDE THE MEANS OF IDENTIFYING THESE TFRS NOR TO IDENTIFY WHEN THEY ARE ACTIVE. AT A MINIMUM; I WOULD SUGGEST THAT AVIATION CHARTS BE AMENDED TO DEPICT THE STADIUMS SUBJECT TO TFR (CAPACITY GREATER THAN 30000) AND THE TFR AROUND IT; WITH THE POSSIBILITY FOR THE PLT TO CALL A PHONE NUMBER OR CONTACT A CTLING AUTHORITY TO VERIFY IF THE TFR IS ACTIVE. ALSO; SPECIFIC TFRS OR NOTAMS COULD BE ISSUED WHENEVER TFRS ARE ACTIVATED. A COMPLEMENTARY OPTION WOULD BE TO HAVE AN OFFICIAL WEB SITE MAKING THIS INFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR IS NOT A SPORTS FAN; AND UNTIL AFTER THIS EVENT; DID NOT KNOW WHERE THE STADIUM WAS LOCATED AND FURTHERMORE DID NOT KNOW UNTIL HE LATER CHECKED THAT THERE WAS AN EVENT IN PROGRESS. HE LOCATED THE STADIUM ON A RAND MCNALLY MAP AND TRANSPOSED IT ONTO HIS VFR CHART. FURTHER; HE USED DUATS TO CHECK HIS VFR FLT AND DID NOT SEE A TFR NOTIFICATION.

I CHKED WX THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON AND FILED IFR. I ALSO CHKED ADDS; DUATS; NOAA WX ON-LINE PRODUCTS; AND THE CNN NEWS WX RPTS. HIGH PRESSURE WAS OVER MY RTE OF FLT WITH MODERATE TURB FORECAST. BEFORE DEPARTING; I CHKED THE ON-LINE COMPUTER AT ZZZ3 AND NOTED NO SIGNIFICANT WX. FREEZING LEVELS WERE AT 6000 FT; BUT WITH HIGH PRESSURE AND NO RAIN IN THE FORECAST I WAS NOT CONCERNED WITH TEMPS. AT 8000 FT MSL; I WAS IN HVY HAZE BUT COULD SEE THE GND. AFTER ABOUT 1 HR; I WAS IN MORE CLOUD THAN HAZE; BUT THERE WAS NO PRECIP. I RECEIVED HDOF TO ZZZ1 AT WHICH TIME I ASKED TO BE OFF-LINE TO CHK IN WITH FSS. FSS INFORMED ME OF CONDITIONS IN THE AREA WITH ICING CONDITIONS AT MY FLT LEVEL. WHILE ON-LINE WITH FSS; I WENT FROM INSTANT NO ICE CONDITION TO AN OPAQUE ICED WINDSHIELD. I THANKED FSS AND IMMEDIATELY WENT BACK TO ZZZ1 AND RPTED MY PROB AND ASKED FOR LOWER ALT. NOT WANTING TO CONTINUE INTO ADVERSE CONDITIONS; I TOLD ZZZ1 I WOULD LIKE LOWER AND AN IMMEDIATE 360 DEG TURN. (I MEANT A 180 DEG REVERSAL OF COURSE.) AFTER WHAT SEEMED LIKE MORE THAN APPROPRIATE TIME AND STILL PICKING UP ICE; I TURNED 180 DEGS; MAINTAINING 8000 FT WITHOUT CLRNC TO DO SO. ZZZ1 THEN CAME ON LINE; ASKED MY HDG; AND CLRED ME TO 6000 FT AND ISSUED A MORE WESTERLY HDG. AFTER A FEW MINS; I WAS THEN HANDED BACK TO ZZZ2. ZZZ2 DID A FANTASTIC JOB OF GIVING ME HDGS AND ALTS THAT WOULD GET ME OUT OF THE ICING CONDITIONS AND HELP ME SHED THE BUILDUP I HAD. I WAS OVER MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN AND WAS LIMITED TO AVAILABLE OPTIONS. THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION AS TO HDGS AND AT TIMES I STOPPED AT ALTS BTWN LAYERS INSTEAD OF THE ASSIGNED ALT. ALTHOUGH I WAS NOT GIVEN CLRNC FOR EACH ACTION; I DID; HOWEVER; INFORM ZZZ2 OF MY ALTS AND HDGS. I WAS ASKED OF MY INTENTIONS AFTER LOSING THE ICE. I INDICATED THAT I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE FLT IF THERE WAS A RTE OUTSIDE OF ICING CONDITIONS. AFTER REACHING 3800 FT AND THE ICE WAS FINALLY GONE; ZZZ2 SUGGESTED A RTE WHERE CONDITIONS WERE MORE FAVORABLE. THE REMAINING FLT WAS UNEVENTFUL. THERE ARE MANY LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE. THE FIRST IS IN THE PREFLT PLANNING. I ASSUMED GOOD WX FROM RPTS; BUT LISTENED TO ONLY THE PORTIONS I WANTED TO HEAR. EXPERIENCE SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME A HIGH PRESSURE IS OFTEN CLOUDY AND WHEN CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST TO BE UNSTABLE WITH TURB; PRECIP IS LIKELY. A LAST CALL TO FSS WOULD HAVE GIVEN ADDITIONAL INFO. THEN THERE IS RECOGNIZING ICING CONDITIONS PRIOR TO CONDITIONS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE SAFETY. WHEN I SAW THAT THE TEMPS WERE NEAR ZERO; IT WAS TIME TO TAKE POSITIVE AND IMMEDIATE ACTION. NOT WAIT UNTIL POTENTIAL DANGER COULD OCCUR. THE FLT 3 DAYS BEFORE HAD BEEN PLANNED TO AVOID WX BY GOING AROUND THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SE. THE SAME CONCEPT SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED ON THE RETURN TRIP. INSTEAD; I ELECTED TO TAKE A FASTER DIRECT RTE HOME. POOR JUDGEMENT. AFTER ICING CONDITIONS OCCURRED; MY FOCUS WAS ON GETTING RID OF THE ICE. I DID NOT COMPLETELY FOLLOW DIRECTIONS BY ATC. UNLESS I WAS IN CONDITIONS WHERE AN EMER NEEDED TO BE DECLARED; ATC INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD BE STRICTLY ADHERED TO. WHEN MY CONDITIONS CHANGED; I SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR CLRNC BEFORE CHANGING MY ALT OR HDG.",,,,"AN IFR C182RG PLT ENCOUNTERED ICE AT HIS FILED 8000 FT ALT AND DIVERTED OFF AIRWAYS WHILE DSNDING CLR OF ICE.",

I RATIONALIZED THAT SINCE WE COULD CHARGE THE BATTERY QUICKLY; OUR OPC REALLY WAS NOT INOP AND; THEREFORE; DID NOT NEED TO BE MEL'ED. I CALLED DISPATCH THROUGH OPS AND GOT OUR TKOF DATA SO WE COULD STILL MAKE OUR TKOF WINDOW. DISPATCH CALCULATED OUR V1; VR; AND V2 OF 113; 113; AND 119.

SPECIFICALLY; WE FREQUENTLY LAND JUST UNDER MAX LNDG WT. IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE HIGH BRAKE TEMPS AND ENHANCE QUICK-TURN TIMES; ACR STATIONS WILL 'CHOCK' THE MAIN WHEELS OF THE ACFT (UPON REQUEST OF THE FLT CREW) AND COORD RELEASE OF THE ACFT PARKING BRAKE. SOP REQUIRES DIRECT COM BETWEEN THE FLT CREW AND THE GND CREW TO ENSURE THIS PROC IS CARRIED OUT CORRECTLY SO THAT THERE WILL BE NO UNPLANNED OR UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT OF THE ACFT. THIS CAN BE EITHER ACCOMPLISHED BY VOICE COMS OVER THE MECHANIC HEADSET; VISUALLY WITH HAND SIGNALS; OR FACE-TO-FACE. IN ANY CASE; DIRECT CONTACT IS REQUIRED BETWEEN THE FLT CREW AND THE GND CREW AND IS ESSENTIAL TO 1) TO VERIFY THAT THE MAIN WHEELS HAVE BEEN CHOCKED PRIOR TO PARKING BRAKE RELEASE AND 2) TO VERIFY THAT THE PARKING BRAKE HAS BEEN SET PRIOR TO PULLING THE CHOCKS FROM THE MAIN WHEELS. IN OP; IT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT CERTAIN GND STATIONS CLEARLY HAVE DIFFICULTY FOLLOWING THE SOP. THIS MAY BE DUE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OR TRAINING; POOR COMS; SHORT STAFFING; OR JUST PLAIN IGNORING THE SOP ALTOGETHER. IN ANY CASE; THIS NEGATIVE TREND MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED AND ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT OCCURS. MY MOST RECENT EXPERIENCE WITH SUCH A LACK OF SOP ADHERENCE WAS AT MDW. AFTER ARRIVING BEHIND SCHEDULE AT MDW FOR A SHORT TURN; WE CALLED OPERATIONS ON THE RADIO AND ARRANGED TO HAVE THE ACFT CHOCKS. AFTER BLOCK-IN; NO ONE CALLED OR OTHERWISE NOTIFIED US THAT THE ACFT HAD BEEN CHOCKED. I WENT OUTSIDE TO PERFORM THE WALK-AROUND. I VISUALLY CONFIRMED WITH THE FO THAT WE HAD BEEN CHOCKED AND TO RELEASE THE PARKING BRAKE. AFTER GOING TO OPS TO TALK TO DISPATCH; AND FINISHED WITH THE WALK-AROUND; I WAS WALKING UP THE JET BRIDGE STAIRS AND NOTICED THE GND CREW REMOVING THE CHOCKS FROM THE MAIN WHEELS. UPON ENTERING THE COCKPIT; I SAW THAT THE PARKING BRAKE WILL STILL RELEASED. I ASKED THE FO IF ANYONE HAD CONTACTED HIM ABOUT REMOVING THE CHOCKS; AND SHE SAID 'NO.' REALIZING THAT THE ACFT WAS FREE TO ROLL; I IMMEDIATELY RE-SET THE PARKING BRAKE! BEFORE PUSH-BACK; I HAD A DETAILED DISCUSSION WITH THE GND CREW ON THE HEADSET; ADVISING THEM OF THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE FLT CREW DIRECTLY; BEFORE PULLING THE WHEEL CHOCKS TO ENSURE THAT THE PARKING BRAKE HAS BEEN RE-SET. I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL VARIATIONS AND SHORT-CUTS TO THE SOP USED IN DEN; LAS; AND NOW MDW. HAVING TALKED WITH OTHER CAPTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE; I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THIS PROB EXISTS AT OTHER STATIONS AROUND THE SYSTEM; AND THE PROB HAS YET TO BE PROPERLY ADDRESSED.

THE SAILPLANE WAS A T-TAIL SINGLE SEAT VERSION. MY FO ALSO SAW THE ACFT FOR AN INSTANT AFTER HE MUST HAVE HEARD ME SAY AN '&^%$#.' THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO TIME FOR AN EVASIVE MANEUVER. THE ACFT APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE AND ITS CROSS SECTION STRAIGHT-ON IN HAZY CONDITIONS MADE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE. I CALLED THE CTR AND SAID I HAD A CLOSE CALL WITH A SAILPLANE AND WAS ASKED HOW CLOSE. I SAID LESS THAN 500 FT; AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED SAYING THAT NO ACFT WAS BEING PAINTED NEAR ME. I WAS THEN HANDED OVER TO CHICAGO APCH CTL AND ALSO TOLD HIM ABOUT THE SAILPLANE ACTIVITY ON THE ARR; AND HE SAID HE WAS GETTING A HIT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IN THAT AREA. I BELIEVE THAT IF WE WERE 100 FT LEFT AND A FEW FT HIGHER; A COLLISION WOULD HAVE OCCURRED. AS A CREW; WE WERE ACTIVELY SCANNING AND PREPARING FOR 'NORMAL' VECTORS TO THE APCH. I SAW NO FAULT IN ATC WHATSOEVER. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY SAILPLANES ARE ALLOWED TO FLY ON A KNOWN ARR RTE TO ONE OF THE BUSIEST AIRSPACES IN THE COUNTRY; ESPECIALLY WITHOUT A XPONDER. I HAVE WRACKED MY BRAIN TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY; BUT FIND NOTHING. WE WERE A STERILE COCKPIT WITH ALL ACFT LIGHTS. I JUST DID NOT SEE THE ACFT COMING; AND ANY REACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO LATE. THE GLIDERS HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE FLYING; BUT MAYBE A CHANGE IN THE ARR RTE AWAY FROM GLIDER FIELDS OR AN ALT CAP FOR THEM IN THAT AREA SHOULD BE LOOKED AT.

HE STATED NO; EMPATHETICALLY NO. I EXPLAINED THE WT AND BAL ISSUES AND HE STATED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD. HE THEN RE-STATED THAT NO EXTRA BAGS HAD BEEN PLACED ON MY AIRPLANE. AT THIS POINT; I DID NOT TRUST HIS STATEMENTS; SO I WALKED BACK TO THE CARGO DOOR WHERE 2 BAGGAGE HANDLERS WERE SHOVING SOME BAGS ON THE ACFT. I ASKED THEM; IN A VERY SUPERVISORY DEMEANOR; HOW MANY BAGS THEY JUST PUT ON MY ACFT. YOU CAN IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN EACH OF THEM GAVE ME A DIFFERENT ANSWER NEITHER OF WHICH WAS 'ONE.' ONE OF THEM SAID 3; THE OTHER SAID 4! AT FIRST I TOLD THEM TO TAKE THEM OFF THE AIRPLANE. AFTER A COUPLE OF SECONDS TO THINK ABOUT IT; I THEN TOLD THEM TO PUT THEM ON THE AIRPLANE AND GIVE ME AN ACCURATE COUNT OF BAGS. THAT DECISION IS THE REASON FOR THIS RPT. AT THIS POINT; ANOTHER SUPVR HAD BEEN CALLED IN. I EXPLAINED TO HIM THE PRECEDING STORY AND THEN TOLD HIM I NEEDED AN ACCURATE COUNT; AND I WOULD REDO THE WT AND BAL. THE BAGGAGE HANDLERS INSISTED THAT ONLY 3 MORE BAGS WERE PLACED ON THE AIRPLANE; SO I WENT WITH THAT NUMBER. MY FO COMPLETED AN ENTIRELY NEW WT AND BAL; WE DOUBLE CHKED THAT ALL OF THE PAPERWORK WAS CORRECT; AND CONTINUED WITH THE FLT. THE SUPVR TOLD ME THAT COMPANY POLICY DICTATES THAT IF A BOARDED PAX'S BAGS SHOW UP; AND THE FLT IS STILL THERE; THE BAG HAS TO GO ON THE PLANE. THIS POLICY MAY BE FINE FOR LARGER ACFT (737 AND LARGER); BUT WITH OUR ACFT AND SMALLER; WHERE WT AND BAL COMES INTO PLAY; THIS IS BAD POLICY. IN RETROSPECT; DUE TO MY DISTRUST OF THE BAG COUNT; I SHOULD HAVE PULLED ALL OF THE BAGS OFF AND HAD THEM DO A RE-COUNT OF THE BAGS. (AGAIN; THIS IS THE REASON FOR THIS RPT.) ALSO; POSSIBLY RETRAINING THE GND PERSONNEL ON HOW SENSITIVE OUR ACFT ARE TO WT AND BAL ISSUES WILL HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHY THEY CAN'T BE THROWING ON BAGS AT THE LAST MINUTE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF 1 BAG MAKING A DIFFERENCE TO SAFETY IS UNLIKELY; BUT; WHAT IF THAT ONE BAG IS A HEAVY BAG; OR LIKE IN THIS INSTANCE; IT WASN'T 1 BAG; BUT 3 OR 4!",,,,"CAPT OF E145 ADVISES THE GND PERSONNEL LOADED ADDITIONAL BAGS AFTER PUSHBACK WITHOUT HIS CONCURRENCE.

APCH HAD ME DSND DOWN TO 5700 FT AND FOR SOME REASON I PUT 5500 FT IN THE ALT WINDOW. I CAUGHT MYSELF DSNDING BELOW THE ASSIGNED ALT ON THE BASE LEG.

SINCE I COULD SEE THE GND MUCH OF THE TIME; I REQUESTED A CONTACT APCH. THE ZLC CTLR SAID HE COULDN'T AUTH THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO AUTH INST APCH INTO LGU. I BELIEVE HE WAS CORRECT. WE SPOTTED A BIG HOLE; SO CANCELED IFR AND LANDED VFR. I WAS REALLY CONCERNED. WHY WOULD THE ONLY APCH INTO CACHE VALLEY BE NOT AUTH ON A NOTAM? IN RESEARCHING THIS; I FOUND THAT A LCL COMPANY THAT BUILDS AMUSEMENT RIDES HAD ERECTED SOME TWRS ABOUT 5.8 MI SSE OF THE RWY. SOMEONE FROM THE FAA NOTICED THE TWRS AND CHKED AND FOUND FAA HAD NOT BEEN ADVISED OF THEM. ALSO; HE DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY WERE IN THE PROTECTED SPACE FOR AN INST APCH. THE RESPONSE WAS TO ISSUE A NOTAM NOT AUTHORIZING THE INST APCH UNTIL IT COULD BE INVESTIGATED. I BELIEVE THESE TWRS ARE NEAR 300 FT HIGH; BUT WELL E OF THE EXTENDED CTRLINE. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN OF THE FAA; BUT AT THE SAME TIME THINK THE ACTION WAS OVERKILL AND CREATED MORE OF A PROB THAT IT WAS TRYING TO SOLVE. IN THIS AREA THE MVA FOR ZLC IS 12000 FT MSL. THERE ARE SEVERAL PEAKS ABOVE 9000 FT MSL. THE FIELD ELEVATION IS 4457 FT. WHEN CLOUDS ARE OBSCURING THE MOUNTAIN TOPS; IT IS MUCH SAFER TO MAKE A GPS PENETRATION TO GET BELOW THE CLOUDS AND THEN CANCEL IFR AND LAND VFR THAN TO SCUD RUN TO GO THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN PASSES VFR BELOW THE CLOUDS. I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER TO ISSUE A NOTAM RESTRICTING THE MDA ON THE GPS APCH TO A HIGHER MDA UNTIL THE TWR ISSUE IS RESOLVED. THIS NOTAM ESSENTIALLY SHUTS DOWN THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING INTO THE VALLEY FROM A HIGHER ALT. IT HAS A VERY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ALL WHO OPERATE JET ACFT INTO LGU. IT HAD A FINANCIAL IMPACT ON A STRUGGLING FBO WHO COULDN'T MAKE A PLANNED LARGE FUEL SELL TO A GULFSTREAM BECAUSE THE GULFSTREAM COULDN'T GET IN; ALTHOUGH THE ARPT WAS VFR. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE ON A NASA RPT; BUT I DO BELIEVE THIS IS THE TYPE OF THING THAT CAUSES FLT CREWS TO DISREGARD THE RULES; CANCEL IFR AND SCUD RUN WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T.

WE WERE IN R CLOSED TFC; FULL STOP LNDGS; TAXI BACK. ON THE THIRD TRIP AROUND THE PATTERN; WE WERE ON R DOWNWIND (EBOUND) CONFIGURED FOR LNDG. THERE WAS TFC INBOUND TO THE ARPT FROM ALL DIRECTIONS WHICH WAS KEEPING THE LCL CTLR QUITE BUSY. RWY IN USE WAS RWY 24. WE CONTINUED EBOUND FOR APPROX 3 MI BEYOND THE END OF THE RWY AT 2000 FT MSL. WITH THE CONGESTION ON THE FREQ THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO RPT DOWNWIND ABEAM THE TWR OR ANYWHERE NEAR IT. THERE WERE NO INSTRUCTIONS FROM LCL CTL TO EXTEND DOWNWIND; PROVIDE SEQUENCE; OR OTHER. THERE APPEARED TO BE NO TFC TO FOLLOW AND NONE OBSERVED INBOUND FROM THE E. IN ORDER TO PREVENT STRETCHING THE PATTERN WAY OUT; I TURNED R BASE AND ADVISED LCL CTL WE WERE TURNING R BASE. WE WERE IMMEDIATELY ADVISED TO CLB SBOUND AND CROSS THE FINAL APCH COURSE. THERE WAS A TWIN FLYING THE ILS THAT PRIOR TO TURNING R BASE WE DID NOT OBSERVE. I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING TO ALERT ME THERE WAS TFC INBOUND ON THE ILS. HOWEVER; AS WE CLBED AS INSTRUCTED WE DID SEE THE TWIN PASS DIRECTLY UNDER US PROBABLY 150-200 FT BELOW. OBVIOUSLY; HAD WE OBSERVED THIS TFC WE WOULD HAVE WAITED UNTIL IT WENT BY BEFORE MAKING ANY TURNS. THIS TFC THEN FELT HE HAD A CONFLICT WITH A SINGLE ENG ACFT THAT LCL CTL HAD SEQUENCED IN FRONT OF HIM. THE TFC THEN ANNOUNCED HE WAS DEPARTING THE AREA FOR AN ARPT THAT HAD COMPETENT CTLRS AND THAT HE INTENDED TO FILE A COMPLAINT. THE CTLR LATER TOLD ME ON THE PHONE THAT I SHOULD NEVER TURN BASE WITHOUT HAVING BEEN GIVEN A SEQUENCE. TO MY KNOWLEDGE; THESE TYPES OF SITS ARE NOT COVERED IN AIM. HOWEVER; HE HAS A VALID POINT; BUT THE QUESTION IS; HOW LONG DO YOU WAIT BEFORE DOING SOMETHING? CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: THIS IS A SINGLE RWY BUSY ARPT WITH A MIX OF EVERYTHING FROM STUDENTS TO BIZJETS. THERE IS A LOT OF FREQ CONGESTION AND IT CAN GO FROM VERY LIGHT TO HVY TFC IN MINS. THERE IS A MIX OF STRAIGHT-IN PRACTICE ILS AND GPS APCH TFC WITH BOTH R AND L TFC PATTERNS. THERE ARE ALSO ARRS FROM SEVERAL RPTING POINTS. I THINK THE CTLR SHOULD HAVE INSTRUCTED US TO TURN BACK TO THE DOWNWIND INSTEAD OF XING THE FINAL APCH COURSE. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO OVERFLT AND BETTER SEPARATION EVEN IF IT STILL WAS LESS THAN STANDARD. THE TWIN WAS IN VFR CONDITIONS AND TOOK NO OBSERVABLE EVASIVE ACTION ALTHOUGH IF I WERE HIM; I WOULD HAVE GONE BELOW GS TO GUARANTEE SEPARATION WHICH HE PROBABLY DID. IN THE FUTURE; IT IS MY RULE TO REMAIN IN THE DOWNWIND LEG UNTIL WE ARE SEQUENCED OR OTHERWISE CLRED EVEN IF THE DOWNWIND LEG BECOMES MUCH LONGER THAN IT SHOULD.

I SAW AN AIRPLANE FAR UP TOWARD THE ARPT AND ALSO SAW ONE TARGET ON TCAS OUT THERE; AND IT APPEARED TO BE NO FACTOR TO US. THE CTLR CALLED OUT TFC AND I SAID; 'I HAVE THAT TFC;' AND MY INSTRUCTOR CALLED BACK THAT WE HAD THE TFC. JUST AS I BEGAN TO DSND; ANOTHER AIRPLANE APPEARED TO BE OVERSHOOTING THE E RWY SO SEVERELY AS TO INTRUDE ONTO OUR FINAL. I CALLED FOR FLAPS 40 DEGS; AND BEGAN SLOWING TO FINAL APCH SPD. THE CTLR SEEMED TO BE MYSTIFIED AT OUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OVERSHOOTING TFC AND SOUNDED AS IF WE SHOULDN'T BE ASKING ABOUT THAT; HE SAID THAT 'WAS' OUR TFC TO FOLLOW. THIS WAS NOT WHAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE CLRED TO FOLLOW. THE CTLR ASKED IF WE COULD SIDESTEP TO RWY 35R; AND WE SAID YES. HE CLRED US SO WE LANDED ON THE E RWY AND TAXIED ACROSS THE ARPT TO RAMP.

ATC HAD REQUESTED BEST FORWARD SPD FOR TFC SEQUENCE PRIOR TO PRESENT CTLR. WE HAD MACH .81 SELECTED IN THE SPD WINDOW AND 'ALT HOLD' ON THE FCP; ALL WITH CAPT'S CONSENT. THE CAPT REQUESTED AND WAS GRANTED A CLB TO FL360 AS PER THE FLT PLAN RELEASE SCHEDULED CLB. DURING THE CLB; OUR SELECTED SPD OF MACH .81 WAS BEGINNING TO PUT US OVER VMO. THE CAPT REACHED UP TO DIAL THE SPD BACK TO MACH .80 BUT OVER SPD WARBLE HAD ALREADY BEEN SET OFF. AT THE SAME TIME THE FO INITIATED A DIFFERENT SOLUTION. THE FO SIMULTANEOUSLY SELECTED 'CTL WHEEL STEERING' (CWS) AND APPLIED BACK PRESSURE TO THE YOKE. THE ACFT'S FORWARD SPD WAS SLOWED AND THE OVER SPD WARNING STOPPED; BUT THE ACFT'S VERTICAL SPD WAS INCREASED. APCHING OUR ASSIGNED ALT; THE FO ANNOUNCED 'ALT STAR' (ALT*); SIGNIFYING THAT THE ALT CAPTURE MODE WAS ENGAGED. BOTH CREW MEMBERS MONITORED THE AUTOPLT AS THE ACFT APCHED FL360 EXPECTING A SMOOTH LEVELOFF; SINCE BOTH FMA'S INDICATED ALT*. AT 36100 FT; BOTH CREW MEMBERS GRABBED THE YOKE; DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT; AND MANUALLY LEVELED THE ACFT BACK TO FL360. DURING THE LEVELOFF; BOTH CREW MEMBERS SAW A MAX ALT OF 36250 FT ON THEIR RESPECTIVE ALTIMETERS. SOMETIME DURING THE MANUAL LEVELOFF THE TCAS ALERTED WITH A TA (ADVISORY ONLY). AT THIS TIME; THE FO GLANCED AT THE VSI/TCAS DISPLAY; AND DID NOT SEE ANY TARGETS. WITHIN A FEW SECONDS; THE ACFT WAS BACK AT FL360; AND THE AUTOPLT WAS BACK ON. AFTER THE AUTOPLT WAS BACK ON; WE WERE QUERIED BY CTR; 'ARE YOU LEVEL AT FL360?' WE WERE; AND WE REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. AFTER THAT QUERY; A TARGET APPEARED ON THE TCAS THREE O'CLOCK POSITION TRANSITING OUR TCAS DISPLAY TOWARD THE TWELVE O'CLOCK POSITION; 1000 FT ABOUT OUR FLT LEVEL. OUR TCAS WAS IN THE 12 MILE RANGE. AT NO TIME DURING THIS EVENT WAS MINIMAL TFC SEPARATION EFFECTED; HOWEVER; THE POTENTIAL EXISTED. THE FO BELIEVED HE HAD RESELECTED THE AUTOPLT BACK TO 'COMMAND' (CMD) SINCE ALT* HAD ANNUNCIATED ON THE FMA DISPLAY; BUT APPARENTLY IT DID NOT REVERT TO CMD MODE WHEN SELECTED. THE CAPT DID NOT NOTICE CWS2 ON HIS FMA AUTOPLT MODE WINDOW AND THAT THE FO HAD SELECTED CWS ON THE FCP. HAD HE KNOWN; HOWEVER; IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE PREVENTED THE OCCURRENCE. THE CAPT WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF USING THE CWS MODE; AND HE WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE A300/A310 AUTOPLT WILL NOT CAPTURE ALT WHEN IN CWS MODE. OUR COMPANY FLT MANUAL (CFM) DOES NOT SPELL THIS OUT VERY WELL. WHAT OUR CFM DOES SAY IS; 'ONE AP ENGAGED IN CTL WHEEL STEERING (CWS). THE AP MAINTAINS PITCH ATTITUDE AND BANK ANGLE EXISTING AT THE MOMENT OF ENGAGEMENT.' ALSO; ONE PAGE STATES; 'AP ENGAGED IN CWS OPERATES INDEPENDENT FD'S.' IF OUR CFM FURTHER ELABORATES ON THE FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITIES OF THE A300/A310 AUTOPLT 'CWS' MODE WITH RESPECT TO ALT CAPTURE I AM UNAWARE OF WHERE THE INFO IS LOCATED. I (THE FO) DISCUSSED THE SCENARIO WITH ANOTHER CAPT. THE CAPT SUGGESTED TRYING TO SEE WHAT IT WILL ACTUALLY DO. WE PURPOSELY SELECTED A CRUISE ALT 2000 FT BELOW AN ALT CLRED TO (SO AS TO PREVENT A PROB WITH ATC) AND SELECTED CWS TO WATCH WHAT WILL HAPPEN. WE WERE SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THE FMA DISPLAYED ALT*; AND THEN IT EVEN DISPLAYED ALT; WHILE THE ACFT KEPT CLBING! THUS THE AP ENGAGED IN CWS OPERATES INDEPENDENT OF FD'S; AS PER CFM. IN RETROSPECT; THE CAPT AND I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A CAUTION OR WARNING INSERTED INTO OUR CFM STATING THE INABILITY OF THE A300/A310 AUTOPLT TO CAPTURE ALT WHEN IN THE CWS MODE. ALSO; IF THE USE OF CWS IS GOING TO BE TAUGHT IN TRAINING TO PUT EMPHASIS ON WHAT THIS AUTOPLT MODE WILL AND WILL NOT DO FOR THE FLT CREW. WE BELIEVE THIS TO BE A CRITICAL ITEM IN THE AGE OF WORLDWIDE RVSM AIRSPACE. LESSONS LEARNED: CAPT: IF ATC REQUESTS A CERTAIN SPD AND YOU GIVE IT TO THEM; YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT SAME SPD AT A HIGHER FLT LEVEL. DO NOT USE CTL WHEEL STEERING (CWS) UNLESS YOU ARE TOTALLY FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IT WILL AND WILL NOT DO FOR YOU. FO: JUST BECAUSE YOU SEE 'ALT*' DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL ACTUALLY CAPTURE THE ALT!

AT LEAST ONE OTHER CREW HAS RPTED THIS SAME BEHAVIOR.

I COMMENTED 'I WISH WE WERE ON RWY 10;' AND ALSO NOTICED THAT WE WERE BEING PUSHED BACK AS IF WE WERE TO TAXI TO RWY 10. (THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MOST DIRECT DEP FOR ZZZ). ANOTHER CARRIER WAS TAXIING IN BEHIND US IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE UNUSUAL PUSHBACK DIRECTION MADE SENSE. AFTER PUSHBACK WE WERE HDG AT 340 DEGS AND I DELIBERATELY TURNED TO MY L BECAUSE I COULD CLR THE TXWY SOONER IN THAT DIRECTION. I DIDN'T VERBALIZE THIS TO MY FO. I NOTICED COMPANY HAD LANDED AND WOULD BE CLRING THE RWY AS WE TAXIED E ON THE RAMP PAST B4. I COMMENTED THAT 'I SHOULD HAVE USED B4' BUT CONTINUED TO B3 TO AVOID A HARD L TURN TO REACH B4. GND THEN SAID TO 'TURN L ON TXWY B3 AND TAXI TO RWY 28L.' I TURNED L ONTO TXWY B3 TO JOIN TXWY B; THEN INITIALLY TURNED R (W) TO TAXI (INCORRECTLY) TO RWY 10. AT THE SAME TIME; MY FO AND JUMPSEATER SAID; 'YOU NEED RWY 28L.' I STARTED THE TURN BACK TO MY L TO TAXI E ON TXWY B TO RWY 28L. I IMMEDIATELY SAW THAT COMPANY WAS CLRING THE ACTIVE RWY 28L ON HIGH SPD TXWY B3; SO I STOPPED FOR THEM TO CLR. THEY ALSO STOPPED FOR US. (THEY WERE IN BTWN THE RWY AND TXWY B.) GND WAS XMITTING SOMETHING THAT SEEMED TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO COMPLETE; ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE SAW ANOTHER CARRIER A300 ON TKOF ROLL. I WANTED TO TELL COMPANY TO 'PULL FORWARD IMMEDIATELY FOR ACFT ON TKOF ROLL;' BUT THE FREQ WAS STILL IN USE. IT SEEMED AS IF TWR AND GND DID NOT SEE THE APCHING NEAR MISS. THE OTHER CARRIER TOOK OFF AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME GND TOLD US TO CONTINUE TO RWY 28L. WE DEPARTED A FEW MINS LATER AND I CALLED PDX GND FROM ZZZ AND TALKED TO THE CTLR WHO HAD BEEN ON THE RADIO WITH US. I SPECIFICALLY ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY PROBS OR COMPLICATIONS FROM WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE; AND SHE SAID 'NO.' THIS WAS A VERY EYE-OPENING AND FRIGHTENING SIT. I SHOULD HAVE TOLD MY FO WHY I WAS TURNING L LEAVING THE GATE AREA. MY TURN WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN TO THE L FOR EITHER RWY BECAUSE IT WAS THE FASTEST WAY FOR ME TO CLR; BUT IT MAY HAVE RESULTED IN A RESPONSE FROM HIM THAT WOULD HAVE KEPT ME FROM THINKING 'RWY 10.' IRONICALLY; IF WE WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TAXIING W ON TXWY B AS IF WE WERE TO USE RWY 10; THE NEAR MISS WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE COMPANY COULD HAVE CLRED EXPEDITIOUSLY AT HIGH SPD B3. I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRYING TO GO TO RWY 10. I THINK I JUST HAD IT IN MY MIND BECAUSE OF THE COMMENT MADE EARLIER IN THE PUSH. I DON'T THINK TWR OR GND SAW THE SIT DEVELOPING BECAUSE THE OTHER CARRIER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CLRED FOR TKOF. I THINK THIS WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR AS WELL SINCE THIS OTHER CARRIER HAD IN FACT BEEN CLRED FOR TKOF BEFORE COMPANY WAS COMPLETELY CLR. HOWEVER; I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS BEING SAID ON TWR FREQ. THERE WAS NO CREW CONFLICT IN FLYING WITH MY FO. I FELT WELL RESTED AND THE WX WAS GOOD. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW QUICKLY THINGS CAN GET VERY SERIOUS IN A MATTER OF SECONDS; EVEN AT A SLOW TAXI SPD. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 657610: AFTER PUSH FROM GATE; WE WERE GIVEN CLRNC TO RWY 28L. CAPT MENTIONED 'I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN US RWY 10.' I CLRED THE AREA TO THE R OF THE ACFT AND WAS MILDLY SURPRISED WHEN HE TURNED L INSTEAD OF R; WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SHORTEST DISTANCE TO RWY 28L. BOTH WERE A WAYS OUT OF THE RAMP THOUGH. AT THIS POINT; A COMPANY ACFT WAS ON LNDG ROLL ON RWY 28L AND EXITED THE HIGH SPD AT TXWY B3. TWR NOTICED THE DIRECTION WE WERE TAXIING AND GAVE US EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS TO EXIT AT TXWY B3 AND TURN L ONTO TXWY B FOR RWY 28L. I WROTE DOWN AND READ BACK THE INSTRUCTIONS. AS WE APCHED TXWY B3; WE BEGAN A L TURN; THEN THE CAPT TURNED R. AT THIS POINT; I SAID (WHILE POINTING) 'NO; L; L; L;' AND THE JUMPSEATER SAID; 'YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO RWY 28L; RIGHT?' THE COMPANY ACFT THAT EXITED AT TXWY B3 HELD HIS POS; STILL ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE HOLD LINE (EFFECTIVELY STILL ON THE RWY). TWR TOLD US TO 'HOLD YOUR POS.' WE STOPPED; 1/2 WAY INTO THE TURN IN TIME TO SEE ANOTHER ACR A300 ON TKOF ROLL. COMPANY STILL HAD NOT EXITED THE RWY AND WE ALL HELD OUR BREATHAS THE A300 ROTATED AND PASSED VERY; VERY CLOSE TO COMPANY'S TAIL. COMPANY WAS ON GND CTL AND MAY NOT HAVE EVEN NOTICED THE CONFLICT. WE DID NOT HEAR ANYTHING FROM THE OTHER CARRIER; SINCE THEY WERE ON TWR FREQ. WE THEN TAXIED BY COMPANY; ON TXWY B TO RWY 28L AND COMPANY ENTERED THE RAMP. IT WAS CLR WHAT HAPPENED. MY CAPT HAD TAKEN THE WRONG RTE; THE COMPANY ACFT SAW A POSSIBLE CONFLICT AND HELD HIS POS (ON THE RWY!). A COMMON THEME TO STORIES LIKE THIS IS THAT CREW MEMBERS NOTICE THAT THEY DON'T 'FEEL RIGHT' ABOUT THE SIT AS IT UNFOLDS. I HAD BEEN FLYING WITH THIS CAPT FOR ALMOST 2 FULL DAYS. HE IS VERY COMPETENT; FLIES BY THE BOOK AND IS OPEN TO CRM. WHEN HE TURNED THE WAY I WOULDN'T HAVE TURNED ON THE RAMP; I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE I ASSUMED HE HAD A REASON. I HAD JUST READ BACK THE CORRECT RWY; WRITTEN IT DOWN AND HE HAD COMMENTED ON HOW HE WISHED WE HADN'T BEEN ASSIGNED THAT PARTICULAR RWY. ALL THIS MADE ME THINK HE KNEW WE WERE GOING TO RWY 28L. THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS; HAD HE BEEN LESS COMPETENT; OR HAD HE SHOWN A TENDENCY TO MAKE MISTAKES; I WOULD HAVE SPOKEN UP IMMEDIATELY; BUT HE IS SUCH A GOOD CAPT; I JUST ASSUMED THAT HE HAD A REASON FOR GOING OUT THE RAMP THE LONG WAY. SOME CAPTS DON'T LIKE SWEEPING R-HAND TAXI TURNS ON RAMP AREAS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SEE; SO I'D SEEN THAT CHOICE MADE BEFORE. WHAT IS INEXPLICABLE IS WHY COMPANY DIDN'T CLR THE RWY ALL THE WAY. 'INEXPLICABLE' PERHAPS ISN'T THE RIGHT WORD. I KNOW HE SAW A POTENTIAL TAXI CONFLICT AND WAS BEING POLITE TO LET US GO BY; BUT THE AIRPLANE WAS STILL ON AN ACTIVE RWY; STILL COMPLETELY ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE HOLD SHORT LINE AND ON THE WRONG FREQ. LUCKILY THE HIGH SPD EXIT WAS LONG ENOUGH FOR A B737 TAIL AND AN A300 WING TO PASS. ALTHOUGH WE CAUSED THE CONFLICT; COMPANY HAD SWITCHED TO GND CTL PRIOR TO EXITING THE RWY; SO HE WAS NO LONGER TALKING (OR LISTENING) TO THE TWR CTLR WHO MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE BEEN YELLING FOR HIM TO EXIT IMMEDIATELY DUE TO A WDB ACFT ON TKOF ROLL. I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS SCARY SIT DRIVES HOME: 1) THE NEED TO SPEAK UP WHEN THINGS DON'T 'FEEL RIGHT' EVEN IF YOUR CAPT IS GREAT; AND 2) EXIT THE ACTIVE IMMEDIATELY. THERE COULD BE AN A300 COMING AT YOU FROM BEHIND THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE YOU SWITCHED FREQS WHILE HOLDING ON THE RWY.",,,,"A TAXI ERROR AT PDX RESULTS IN A GND CONFLICT THAT PREVENTS A B737 EXITING RWY 28L FROM COMPLETELY CLRING THE RWY WHILE AN A300 DEPARTED ON THE SAME RWY.",

WE WERE FLYING A SMALL ACFT. 77G IS TYPICALLY USED AS OUR FUEL STOP ON FLTS FROM THE MINNEAPOLIS AREA TO THE EAST COAST AND THE SAME ON THE RETURN TRIP. 77G IS SERVED BY TWO RWYS THAT INTERSECT. THE WINDS AT 77G WERE LIGHT OUT OF THE N. ON ARR; WE ELECTED TO LAND ON RWY 9 SINCE IT WAS THE LONGER OF THE TWO RWYS AVAILABLE. WE CANCELLED IFR APPROX 14 MILES FROM 77G AND SWITCHED TO CTAF. WE TAXIED TO THE SELF SERVICE PUMPS AFTER A ROUTINE LNDG ON RWY 9. WHILE I WAS FILLING THE ACFT; WE OBSERVED A GLIDER TKOF ON RWY 1 USING SOME TYPE OF CABLE/ WINCH SYSTEM OPERATED BY A LARGE ENG AT THE DEPARTURE END OF RWY 1. A LOCAL PLT SAID IT WAS COMMON TO SEE GLIDERS LAUNCHED USING THE CABLE AT 77G. 'THAT'S A HEAVY DUTY CABLE;' ACCORDING TO THE PLT. AFTER A GLIDER WAS LAUNCHED; THE CABLE WOULD PARACHUTE TO THE GROUND AND GROUND PERSONNEL WOULD DRIVE A GOLF CART DOWN THE RWY TO PICK IT UP AND BRING IT BACK TO THE APCH END OF THE RWY FOR ANOTHER GLIDER TOW. AFTER OUR REFUELING; WE ANNOUNCED WE WERE TAXIING TO RWY 27 FOR DEP ON THE CTAF. RWY 27 WAS REQUIRED BECAUSE THE LENGTH OF RWY 1 WAS INADEQUATE FOR OUR TKOF WEIGHT. ANOTHER ACFT; A PIPER ARROW; ANNOUNCED HE WAS TAXIING ON RWY 1 FOR DEP. WE ALSO NOTED THE GOLF CART WAS TRAVELING ALONG THE EDGE OF RWY 1 APPARENTLY CARRYING THE CABLE BACK TO THE APCH END OF RWY 1.

THE INTERSECTION OF RWY 27 AND RWY 1 WAS ACTUALLY INVISIBLE DUE TO THE SLOPE OF THE RWY. WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THE ARROW DEPART; BUT WE DIDN'T SEE THE GOLF CART CROSS THE RWY. HE DID. AND HE STRUNG THE CABLE ACROSS THE RWY; TOO. ON OUR TKOF ROLL; I ANNOUNCED TO THE PF THE GOLF CART IS GONE; HE CROSSED. WE WERE TOO LATE TO ABORT OUR TKOF. AS WE NEARED THE INTXN; I DID SEE THE HEAVY DUTY CABLE LAYING ON THE RWY. WE STRUCK THE CABLE WITH THE NOSE AND BOTH MAINS WHILE TRAVELING APPROX 85 TO 90 KIAS.

AFTER STABILIZING THE ACFT INBOUND TO RWY 30L; THE APCH SPD WAS STILL HIGH. WHILE THE INSTRUCTOR PLT WAS RUNNING THE APCH CHKLIST; I DEPLOYED THE FLAPS TO FULL. THE IP NOTED THAT I HAD TOO HIGH OF AN AIRSPD FOR FULL FLAPS. WE LEFT THEM IN AS I PITCHED TO SLOW THE AIRSPD BELOW FLAP SPD. DURING THIS TIME; THE LNDG GEAR WARNING HORN WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY IGNORED BY ME. IT HAD BEEN SOUNDING SINCE WE PULLED A THROTTLE BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ENG OUT PRACTICE ON A SHORT R BASE LEG. APPARENTLY; THE WARNING HORN NEVER STOPPED AS I PUT IN FULL FLAPS. AS WE SLOWED TO A MORE REASONABLE APCH SPD; BOTH OF US CONCENTRATED ON AIRSPD AND THE SIGHT PICTURE AND THE IP DISCONTINUED THE READING OF THE CHKLIST. DURING THE FLARE; I LEFT PWR IN FOR A SMOOTHER TOUCHDOWN. AS THE PLANE GRADUALLY SANK DURING THE LONG ROUNDOUT; WE BEGAN TO HEAR METAL CONTACTING THE RWY. THE IP THOUGHT HE HEARD DRAGGING FLAPS WHILE I THOUGHT I HEARD THE TICKING OF SOMETHING LIKE A PROP HITTING. WITHOUT HESITATION; I PITCHED UP WHILE ADDING GAR PWR. THE IP WAS SAYING; 'GO; GO; GO!' ON THE CLBOUT; WE NOTICED BOTH THE GEAR HANDLE UP AND THE WARNING HORN. WE SELECTED FLAPS UP AND THE WARNING SILENCED. THE PLANE FLEW EXACTLY AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. THERE WAS NO OUT-OF-BAL FEELING FROM EITHER ENG. THE PLT ACTING AS IP FOR THAT APCH (HE WAS LISTED OFFICIALLY AS PIC FOR THE FLT) DECIDED THAT WE MUST HAVE ONLY DRUG A FLAP. BASED ON THAT; WE FLEW THE EXTRA SHORT DISTANCE FROM ZZZ TO ZZZ1; THE HOME BASE FOR THE PLANE. I FLEW THE PLANE TO A FULL STOP USING A NO FLAP APCH. IT WAS WHEN WE STOPPED THE ENGS WHEN WE DISCOVERED THAT WE DID INDEED STRIKE THE 6 PROP BLADES. THE DAMAGE WAS TO THE LAST 3 OR 4 INCHES OF THE PROP TIPS. ALSO DAMAGED WAS THE L INBOARD FLAP AND THE ENTRY STEP THAT PROTRUDES LOW BEHIND THE R INBOARD FLAP. HUMAN FACTORS FOR THIS INCIDENT MAY INCLUDE THE COMPLACENCY WE EACH FELT WITH THE OTHER EXPERIENCED PLT ON BOARD; THE SHORT TURN TO FINAL WITH THE SIMULATED LOSS OF AN ENG DURING THE TURN; AND THE CONCEPT THAT WE CAN PUSH OURSELVES IN A TRAINING SIT WHERE WE MIGHT OTHERWISE FLY AROUND TO BUY TIME TO FIX A PROB AND RUN AN ABNORMAL OR EMER CHKLIST IN A REAL LIFE SIT. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 658000: BOTH OF US ARE PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED PLTS WHO RECEIVE ANNUAL TRAINING ON TURBOJET ACFT.

IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MS X WAS A REVENUE PAX ON FLT XXX; SFO-ZZZ. THE PAX AGENT INFORMED ME THAT MS X ARRIVED LATE AND HER SEAT HAD BEEN RELEASED. SHE THEN REQUESTED THE JUMPSEAT WHICH WAS PRESENTLY ASSIGNED TO 2 ACR X CAPTS. MS X WAS TOLD BY THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP THAT SHE WAS NOT ENTITLED TO THE JUMPSEAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES; BUT THAT HE WOULD CHK WITH THE CAPT. AFTER MY DISCUSSION WITH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP; THE FO AND I REFERENCED THE FOM AND CONFIRMED OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT IF MS X WAS TO BE GRANTED COCKPIT AUTHORITY UNDER PRIORITY STATUS; SHE WOULD NEED TO PRESENT A VALID FAA ID; FORM XXX. AND AN OMC BOARDING CARD. I INFORMED THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP OF THIS AND HE TOLD ME THAT MS X WAS OUTSIDE THE COCKPIT DOOR AND WANTED TO TALK WITH ME. AT THIS TIME; MS X ENTERED THE COCKPIT. PRESENT AT THE TIME WAS MYSELF; THE FO; AND BOTH CAPT OMCS. MS X PRESENTED HER ID AND STATED THAT SHE WAS ENTITLED TO THE JUMP SEAT IN THE CAPACITY OF AN FAA SAFETY INSPECTOR. AS I BEGAN TO DISCUSS THE REQUIRED CREDENTIALS; MS X INTERRUPTED ME AND STATED THAT SHE 'WAS AWARE OF FORM XXX' BUT THAT SHE 'DOES NOT NEED IT TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE JUMPSEAT.' I TOLD HER THAT I WAS REQUIRED TO WORK WITHIN THE RULES OF THE FOM AND ATTEMPTED TO SHOW HER THE COMPANY REGULATIONS. SHE STATED THAT SHE KNEW WHAT THE MANUAL SAID; BUT THAT I HAD DISCRETION TO WORK AROUND THAT AND NOT REQUIRE FORM XXX. I TOLD HER THAT I COULD NOT DO THAT AND AS I ATTEMPTED TO FURTHER ELABORATE; SHE AGAIN INTERRUPTED ME AND BECAME MORE AGGRESSIVE AND INSISTENT ON HER POSITION THAT I MAY DEVIATE FROM THE FOM IN THIS CASE. AT THIS TIME I SUGGESTED THAT I CALL THE FLT MANAGERS IN SFO TO SEE IF THEY HAD AUTHORITY TO AUTHORIZE HER REQUEST. WHILE I WAS ON THE JETWAY PHONE; MS X BEGAN AN INSPECTION OF MY CREW'S DOCUMENTS. WITHOUT PRESENTING ID TO THE PURSER; SHE ASKED FOR HIS NAME AND EMPLOYEE NUMBER. SHE ENTERED THE COCKPIT AND SAID; 'MR COPLT; I WANT TO SEE YOUR LICENSE AND MEDICAL.' THE FO COOPERATED AND PRESENTED THESE DOCUMENTS. MS X THEN COPIED DOWN THE INFO. I HAD A BIT OF WAIT ON THE PHONE BECAUSE A FLT MANAGER HAD TO BE LOCATED. I WAS THEN ASKED IF I COULD HOLD BECAUSE THE FLT MANAGER WAS ON THE PHONE; TO WHICH I RESPONDED THAT OUR FLT WAS NOW DELAYED DUE TO AN ISSUE WITH AN FAA INSPECTOR. THE FLT MANAGER WAS ADVISED AND HE TOOK MY CALL. I EXPLAINED THE SIT AND ASKED IF HE HAD THE AUTHORITY TO AUTHORIZE THE JUMPSEAT. HE SAID NO; BUT THAT HE WOULD TALK TO THE FLT OPS DUTY MANAGER AND MEET ME AT THE GATE. THIS INFO IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE LATER IN THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS; WHILE THE FLT MANAGER WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THE FLT OPS DUTY MANAGER; MS X ACCUSED ME OF 'SPENDING A LONG TIME ON THE PHONE IN ORDER TO CONSPIRE WITH THE FLT MANAGER TO DENY HER THE JUMPSEAT.' AS I STATED ABOVE; THIS WAS NOT WHAT TRANSPIRED DURING THAT PHONE CALL. AFTER MY PHONE CONVERSATION WITH THE FLT MANAGER; I WENT BACK TO THE ACFT AND FOUND MS X IN THE GALLEY WITH TWO FLT ATTENDANTS. SHE ASKED ME FOR MY LICENSE AND MEDICAL. WHILE WRITING DOWN MY INFO; MS X AGAIN TOLD ME THAT 'ACR X ONLY SELECTIVELY REQUIRES FORM XXX AND THAT I MUST USE MY AUTHORITY AS PIC TO DEVIATE FROM THE FOM;.' I TOLD HER I COULD NOT DO THAT; BUT THAT I HAD COMPLETED THE PHONE CALL AND A FLT MANAGER WAS ON THE WAY. I FURTHER STATED THAT I FELT IT WAS UNFAIR AND UNPROFESSIONAL OF HER TO CONTINUE TO ASK ME TO DEVIATE FROM THE EXPLICIT RULES OF THE FOM. I ALSO TRIED; BUT WAS CONTINUALLY INTERRUPTED; TO TELL HER THAT I FELT HER CONTINUED INSISTENCE THAT I DEVIATE WAS RISING TO THE LEVEL OF STRONG-ARMING AND INTIMIDATION ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT I HAD SOLICITED MY FLT MANAGER FOR HER; EVEN THOUGH OUR FLT WAS NOW DELAYED. SHE NEXT TOLD ME THAT IF I DID NOT DO WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO THAT 'YOU'LL PAY' AND 'ACR X WILL PAY' AS SHE POINTED HER INDEX FINGER AT MY FACE. SHE CONTINUED; 'I KNOW HOW THESE THINGS WORK BECAUSE I USED TO WORK WITH ACR X IN CERTIFICATION.' IN MY DEBRIEF WITH THE PURSER; HE STATED THAT WHILE I WAS ON THE PHONE; SHE SAID THAT 'IF SHE DOES NOT GET ON THIS FLT; HEADS WILL ROLL.' THIS SIT CONCLUDED WHEN THE FLT OPS DUTY MANAGER TOLD HER THAT SHE WILL NOT BE GRANTED ACCESS WITHOUT THE REQUIRED FORM XXX. THE FLT THEN DEPARTED 27 MINUTES LATE. THERE ARE A FEW MORE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE. FIRST; THE FO; 2 OMC'S; AND I; ALL FELT THAT MS X'S CONDUCT PRESENTED A POTENTIAL SAFETY OF FLT ISSUE AS SHE APPLIED UNDUE PRESSURE AND INTIMIDATION ON THE CREW. SECOND; UPON THE FLT MANAGER'S ARR TO THE GATE; I INFORMED HIM THAT REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME; I WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED ON THIS FLT IF MS X WAS GRANTED ACCESS BECAUSE OF HER THREATS; ACTIONS; AND GENERAL CONDUCT. I HAVE ALSO INFORMED MY FLT MANAGER AND THE FLT OPS DUTY MANAGER THAT I MUST RESPECTFULLY DECLINE TO FLY ANY FUTURE FLTS WITH MS X IN THE COCKPIT BECAUSE OF MY CONCERNS ABOUT HER THREAT TO 'MAKE ME PAY.' I'M AFRAID THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY CREATED BY THIS WOULD BE A DISTRACTION AND THEREFORE INFRINGE ON THE SAFE OP OF THE FLT. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 657794: SHE ADDRESSED ME AS 'MR COPLT' AND ASKED FOR MY LICENSE AND MEDICAL. THEN; HEARD BY THE FLT ATTENDANTS; THE 2 OMC'S; AND POSSIBLY THE FIRST CLASS PAX; MS X STATED THAT; 'IF I DON'T GET ON THIS FLT; HEADS WILL ROLL.' IT IS MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION THAT IF MS X EVER CONDUCTED AN FAA CHECK AT ACR X THAT RESULTED IN A VIOLATION OF THE CREW; BASED ON HER STATEMENTS; I WOULD HAVE SERIOUS DOUBTS AS TO THE CREDIBILITY OF SUCH ACTIONS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR ACN 657791 REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE CAPT ADDED THAT THE INSPECTOR REMAINED HOSTILE AND DEMANDING UNTIL THE ACR CHIEF PLT SUGGESTED THEY CONTACT THE POI ASSIGNED TO THE CARRIER. AT THAT POINT THE INSPECTOR STATED THAT WOULDN'T BE NECESSARY AND CEASED MAKING DEMANDS. RPTR ADVISED THAT THE COMPANY HAS DISCUSSED THIS INCIDENT; FOUND THE CREW TO HAVE ACTED PROPERLY AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH COMPANY'S OPS MANUAL REQUIREMENT FOR COCKPIT ACCESS. IT IS HIS UNDERSTANDING THE FAA WILL BE TAKING ACTION TO REINFORCE TO THEIR INSPECTORS THE NEED TO STRICTLY COMPLY WITH COCKPIT ACCESS PROTOCOLS DURING THEIR INSPECTION ACTIVITIES. THE RPTR WAS ADVISED IT WAS UNLIKELY THE INSPECTOR WOULD BE PERSONALLY CONFRONTED. RPTR STATED HE CONTINUED TO BE UNWILLING TO UNDERGO AN ENRTE CHK FROM THIS INSPECTOR IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF HER OVERT THREATS DURING THE ORIGINAL ALTERCATION.",,,,"FLT CREW OF AN A320 ARE CONFRONTED BY AN IMPROPERLY CREDENTIALED FAA SAFETY INSPECTOR DEMANDING ACCESS TO COCKPIT JUMP SEATS IN CONTRADICTION TO ACR POLICY.

THE ONLY ANOMALY WE NOTED PRIOR TO THE EVENT WAS THAT AS WE DID OUR SINGLE ENG TAXI FROM THE GATE IN ZZZ1; JUST AS I WAS ABOUT 1/2 WAY THROUGH MY FIRST TURN TO THE L AWAY FROM THE GATE; WE RECEIVED A MASTER CAUTION WITH AN ECAM MESSAGE STATING THE FLT CTLS WERE IN ALTERNATE LAW. FO LOOKED UP TO THE OVERHEAD PANEL TO SEE IF ANY FLT CTL COMPUTERS HAD FAULTED; NONE HAD; WHILE I ROLLED OUT OF THE TURN. BY THE TIME WE LOOKED BACK AT THE ECAM SCREEN; THE MESSAGE WENT AWAY. FIGURING IT WAS SIMPLY A MOMENTARY FALSE WARNING (WE DO GET QUITE A LOT OF THOSE); WE CONTINUED ON. THE FLT WAS FLOWN NORMALLY AND THE ACFT BEHAVED NORMALLY. ON THE DSCNT; I TURNED OFF THE AUTOTHRUST AND AUTOPLT SYS AND HAND FLEW THE APCH. WE WERE IN LIGHT TURB FOR ABOUT THE LAST 10 MINS OF THE FLT; AND THERE WERE NO EXCURSIONS OUTSIDE WHAT YOU WOULD CALL NORMAL FOR THAT AMOUNT OF TURB. FOR THE FINAL APCH; THE JET WAS POINTED JUST A FEW DEGS TO THE R OF THE RWY CTRLINE DUE TO A XWIND. AT AROUND 50 FT AGL; I INPUT L RUDDER TO ALIGN WITH THE RWY. I APPLIED THE NORMAL AMOUNT OF FORCE; FELT NOTHING AND NOTICED NO MOVEMENT OF THE NOSE. AT THIS POINT I CAN SAY THAT I STILL DIDN'T FEEL THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG. I PUSHED HARDER; THIS TIME ABOUT TWICE AS HARD AS I NORMALLY DO; AND THAT'S WHEN MY THOUGHTS WENT TO THE 'UH-OH' MODE WHEN I HAD NOTED NO YAW YET. I PRESSED A LITTLE HARDER AND THE RUDDER PEDAL IMMEDIATELY (SOUNDLESSLY) SNAPPED FORWARD. THE NOSE YAWED IMMEDIATELY L AT THE SAME TIME. I STOPPED THE RUDDER; APPLIED LESS PRESSURE ON THE L PEDAL SO AS TO USE JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT REQUIRED TO ALIGN TO THE RWY; AND I CONTINUED THE FLARE MANEUVER AND LANDED. THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK FOR ALL THIS TO HAPPEN I'LL ESTIMATE AT AROUND 3 SECONDS. DURING THE LNDG ROLL; IMMEDIATELY AFTER TOUCHING DOWN; I ASKED THE FO IF HE HAD HIS FEET ON THE PEDALS. HE HAD HIS FEET FLAT ON THE FLOOR; SO IT WASN'T HIM. ALSO; IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A 'HVY' PEDAL; ONE THAT HAD SOMEONE ELSE'S APPENDAGE ON IT -- IT FELT LIKE IT FROZE AND ABRUPTLY BROKE FREE. AFTER TAXIING CLR OF THE RWY; WE BOTH DID MULTIPLE FULL RUDDER DEFLECTIONS WITH NO ADVERSE FEEL OR EFFECT. WE WATCHED THE ECAM SCREEN AND IT SHOWED THAT THE RUDDER WAS MOVING ALONG WITH OUR PEDAL INPUTS. THERE WAS A SMALL 'BUMP' EACH TIME I PUSHED THE L RUDDER PEDAL JUST A LITTLE BIT INTO THE MOVEMENT. I CALL IT A BUMP FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD; IT WAS JUST A LITTLE TINY THING. THE MOVEMENT WAS NOT HAMPERED IN ANY WAY BY IT; BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY A 'HITCH' IN THE OTHERWISE SMOOTH RUDDER MOVEMENT. IT FELT ALMOST LIKE JUST THE SLIGHTEST SLOP IN THE LINKAGE THAT WOULD CATCH UP RIGHT THERE. IT WAS SO SLIGHT THAT I ALMOST DIDN'T MENTION IT IN THIS RPT; BUT WHEN THE FO DID HIS RUDDER PEDALS; HE FELT NOTHING BUT SMOOTH MOVEMENT. I COULDN'T FEEL IT WHEN PUSHING THE R PEDAL; ONLY THE L. THE CONCERN I HAVE WITH ZEROING IN ON THIS BUMP IS THAT IT HAPPENS A LITTLE WAY INTO THE MOVEMENT; INSTEAD OF AT THE TOP OF THE MOVEMENT LIKE HAD HAPPENED ON APCH (ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE HARD TO SAY EXACTLY WHERE IN THE MOVEMENT CYCLE THE FREEZE-UP OCCURRED BASED ON MY LEG MOVEMENT; THERE WAS NO NOTICEABLE NOSE YAW UNTIL IT BROKE FREE; MEANING TO ME THAT THE PEDAL DIDN'T MOVE AT ALL UNTIL IT CAME LOOSE. FDR INFO WILL HAVE TO BE CHKED TO SEE IF; JUST A SECOND OR SO PRIOR TO THE BREAK; THE RUDDER PEDALS DID IN FACT MOVE AND IF THERE WAS A SLIGHT CTLED L YAW INDUCED THAT I COULD HAVE MISSED IN THE LIGHT TURB). I'M NOT COMPLETELY DISCOUNTING THIS PARTICULAR SPOT IN THE MOVEMENT AS 'THE' FREEZE POINT; JUST POINTING OUT THAT NOT ALL THE FACTS SEEM TO SUPPORT IT. AT THE GATE; I SEARCHED UNDER AND BEHIND BOTH RUDDER PEALS TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THERE THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE PROB. I SAW NOTHING AT ALL; BUT NOTED THAT THIS PARTICULAR ACFT DIDN'T HAVE THE FOD/DIRT/DUST SCREEN ON THE CTR PEDESTAL WHERE THE RUDDER PEDALS MOVE FORWARD AND BACK (THE 'PLASTIC GRASS' THAT GUARDS THE AREA AROUND AND UNDER THE PEDALS). THE LACK OF THIS GUARD MADE IT EASIER TO LOOK DOWN INTO THAT AREA; BUT LIKE I SAID BEFORE; ALL I COULD SEE WAS LOTS OF DUST AND DIRT. THERE WAS NO NOISE BEFORE; DURING OR AFTER THE INCIDENT. THERE WAS NO GRINDING NOTICEABLE. THE RUDDER INDICATION ON THE ECAM SCREEN SMOOTHLY FOLLOWED ALL RUDDER INPUTS. THE OUTBOUND CAPT OPENED THE E&E COMPARTMENT TO SEE IF HE COULD SEE ANYTHING FROM UNDERNEATH; AND HE; TOO; LOOKED FOR ANY FOREIGN OBJECTS AND COULD FIND NOTHING. I CALLED MAINT AND COORD WITH ZZZ1 OPS TO START THE BALL ROLLING FOR THE MECHANICAL DELAY AND MAINT PROB. I REALIZE THIS IS A FAIRLY COMPLEX ISSUE AND I HOPE TO HAVE GIVEN YOU ENOUGH INFO TO WORK WITH.",,,,"AN A319 CREW EXPERIENCED A RUDDER ANOMALY DURING LNDG RESULTING IN PEDAL RESISTANCE AND REDUCED RUDDER MOVEMENT.",

EVERYTHING ABOUT OUR PUSHBACK; TAXI AND TAKEOFF WERE NORMAL. I WAS FLYING THE AIRPLANE. AFTER TAKEOFF I CALLED FOR HDG MODE FOR THE FLT DIRECTOR; WHICH THE FO SELECTED. WE FLEW STRAIGHT OUT AND I CALLED FOR THE AFTER TAKEOFF CHKLIST. ATC INSTRUCTED US TO TURN L AND INTERCEPT THE DEP; WHICH WE DID. THE CTLR TOLD US THIS WAS; 'PART OF THE DEP PROC.' WE BOTH REALIZED IT IS PART OF THE PROC AND JOINED THE DEP PATH WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. WHY HAD WE NOT JOINED THE DEP? WE WERE TIRED. IT IS MOST COMMON TO FLY STRAIGHT OUT USING HDG MODE AND IF NOT; TO UTILIZE NAV MODE; WHICH ENGAGES THE FMS TO TRACK A DEP OUTBOUND. THIS PARTICULAR DEP USES HDG MODE TO INTERCEPT THE DEP; SO HDG; THEN NAV MODE IS REQUIRED AFTER TKOF. THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT; WE WERE TIRED; DISTR AND LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING HOME. IT OCCURS TO ME THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE ASRS RPTS OUTLINING ERRORS I'VE SUBMITTED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE HAD ONE COMMON THEME. TIREDNESS. NOT NECESSARILY FROM FLYING FATIGUE; BUT FROM TIME ON DUTY. I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THE SINGLE GREATEST ENHANCEMENT TO FLT SAFETY WOULD BE AN OVERHAUL OF THE REST RULES FOR DOMESTIC CARRIERS. THE MAXIMUM SCHEDULED DUTY DAY SHOULD BE CAPPED AT 12 HRS WITH AN EXTENSION OF PERHAPS 1-2 HRS ONLY FOR OPERATIONAL DELAYS. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FLT TIME IN A DAY COULD BE RAISED TO 9 HRS -- BECAUSE THE FLT TIME IS OFTEN NOT THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE FATIGUE; IT'S THE DUTY TIME. FINALLY; THE MINIMUM REST IN A GIVEN CALENDAR DAY SHOULD BE INCREASED 1 HR. THE LIMITS ON MAXIMUM FLYING PER WEEK; MONTH AND YEAR? THEY ONLY COST ME MONEY -- I'VE NEVER GOTTEN ANY MORE REST OR BEEN BETTER PREPARED FOR FLYING BECAUSE OF THOSE RESTRICTIONS. THE LIMITS OF PART 135 WERE FINE: 34 HRS IN 7 DAYS; 120 HRS PER MONTH AND 1200 HRS PER YEAR. THOUGH I DID NOT INTEND TO WRITE A DIATRIBE ON REST; IT IS RELEVANT TO THE SIT DESCRIBED ABOVE. ALSO; AT THE AIRLINE I WORK AT; A NUMBER OF ERRORS ARE BEGINNING TO OCCUR WITH DEPS. THOUGH OUR TRAINING DEPT FEELS THEY ARE FMS PROGRAMMING ERRORS; I'M NOT CONVINCED. I BELIEVE THAT PLTS ARE USED TO ROUTINE AND UNUSUAL DEPS; SUCH AS THE RIVER 6 DEP IN PDX THAT SEEM SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD CAN BE EASILY MISMANAGED WHEN FATIGUE SETS IN AND WE RESORT TO THE FAMILIAR. IF DEPS WERE DESIGNED SO THAT ONLY ONE MODE NEED BE SELECTED; THERE WOULD BE LESS OPPORTUNITY FOR ERROR AT A TIME WHEN THE MARGINS FOR SUCH ERROR ARE GREATLY REDUCED.",,,,"FLT CREW OF CARJ FAIL TO FOLLOW RIVER DEP PROC UNTIL REMINDED BY ATC.

THIS JUMP AREA IS ALSO LISTED IN THE AFD (EC). THIS CAN BE FOUND ON THE DETROIT SECTIONAL; JUST W OF CAK'S AIRSPACE. THE PROB IS; THIS JUMP AREA (AT HILTY FIELD-PVT) RATHER CONFLICTS WITH THE FOLLOWING: V525 AIRWAY; WOOSTER/WAYNE COUNTY (BJJ) GPS RWY 28 APCH USING GIMMU INTXN; WADSWORTH (3G3) RNAV (GPS) RWY 2 APCH; WADSWORTH (3G3) RNAV (GPS) RWY 20 MISSED APCH. GRANTED THE APCHES WILL BE COVERED BY CAK RADAR (APCH) DURING MVFR AND IMC. BUT FOR THE AMOUNT OF FLT TRAINING THAT IS GOING ON IN THE AREA; DURING VMC CONDITIONS; THIS IS A PROB. PRIOR TO A JUMP; EITHER THE HILTY FIELD OR THE JUMP ACFT MAKES AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON 122.8 (UNICOM FOR 3G3 AND BJJ). I WOULD ASSUME THAT THEY ALSO MAKE THE SAME ANNOUNCEMENT ON 123.05 (15G-WELTZIEN SKY PARK). THE PROB WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS IT APPEARS TO BE AUTOMATED; IF YOU ATTEMPT TO CONTACT THEM THERE IS NO ANSWER. TRANSIENT ACFT WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON AS FAST AS THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS MADE. THIS PARTICULAR ACTIVITY NEEDS TO BE COVERED BY NOTAM IN MY OPINION. THIS IS SO THAT WHEN THEY (HILTY FIELD JUMPERS) ARE ACTIVE; IT WILL BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF PLTS GETTING A BRIEFING . IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO DEPART 3G3 OR BJJ AND CONTACT CAK APCH AS YOU DEPART THE PATTERN TO BE TOLD; '12345 MAKE AN IMMEDIATE TURN TO XXX DEGS. AND; UH; RADAR CONTACT 12345.' I HAPPEN TO LIVE IN THE AREA; FLY TO AND FROM BJJ AND 3G3. YET UNLESS YOU ARE ON ONE OF THEIR BROADCAST FREQS; YOU WON'T KNOW THAT THEY ARE ACTIVE UNLESS YOU GET AN ALERT FROM CLE OR CAK APCH. ADDITIONAL INFO: THERE IS A LANDMARK IN THE AREA CALLED THE SALT SHAKER. THIS IS A POINT THAT 15G PLTS ARE TAUGHT TO LOOK FOR AND FLY OVER WHEN COMING BACK TO SKY PARK. WHEN COMING FROM THE BRIGGS VOR; THESE STUDENTS WILL FLY RIGHT INTO THIS JUMP AREA. THIS JUMP AREA IS ALSO AT A 'CHOKE POINT' WHERE ACFT ARE SETTING UP TO PASS BETWEEN THE CAK AND CLE AIRSPACES. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT FAA NEEDS TO CHANGE THE PROCS IN THIS AREA FOR SAFETY REASONS TO REQUIRE A NOTAM CHANGE TO BE FILED WHEN THE JUMP AREA GOES ACTIVE SO THAT PLTS WILL KNOW WHEN THE AREA IS 'HOT.' CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATED THAT BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF VFR AND IMC TFC IN THIS AREA; GREATER VIGILANCE IS REQUIRED. TRANSIENT PLTS MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT THE JUMP AREA IF NOT RECEIVING FLT FOLLOWING OR MONITORING THE UNICOMS. RPTR ALSO STATED THAT THE JUMPERS WILL GO AS HIGH AS 14000 FT OVER RITZS INTXN UNDER CLEVELAND'S WATCH. IFR ACFT ON THE KEATN TWO ARR TO CLE EXPECTING TO CROSS AT 10000 FT.

I INSPECTED FOR MISSING OR BROKEN SAFETY WIRE ON THE TORQUE TUBE NUT AT LOWER END OF THE SCREW. I ALSO INSPECTED FOR CORROSION OR DAMAGE OF THE SCREW THREADS. I RPTED THAT THE FINDINGS WERE OK. I INSPECTED FOR METAL FRAGMENTS/SHAVINGS AND RPTED FINDINGS AS 'NO.' I LUBRICATED THE HORIZ STABILIZER ACTUATOR ASSEMBLY. I MOVED THE HORIZ STABILIZER TO THE FULL ACFT NOSE DOWN (AND) POS.

WE TAXIED FOR TKOF ON RWY 1L; ADVISING THE CTLR THAT WE INTENDED TO WAIT FOR THE WX TO MOVE FURTHER E. AN ACR FLT; IN TKOF POS; ELECTED NOT TO DEPART DUE TO WX ON THE DEP CORRIDOR.

FLASHES OF LIGHTNING WERE EVIDENT; HOWEVER; WE WERE IN IMC AND COULD NOT DISCERN SPECIFIC LOCATION. AT THAT POINT; I OBSERVED A MASTER CAUTION LIGHT ILLUMINATED ON THE GLARE SHIELD AND AN ILLUMINATED 'CONFIGN' KEY ON THE CTR CONSOLE. I DETERMINED THAT A 'RUDDER LIMIT FAIL' ALERT WAS ON THE EAD. AS I WAS ABOUT TO CALL FOR THE QRH; THE ACFT APPEARED TO PITCH ABRUPTLY DOWNWARD AND THE AUTOPLT DISCONNECTED. I TOOK THE YOKE AS DID THE FO. WE NOTED THAT AIRSPD WAS BUILDING RAPIDLY AND THAT WE WERE LOSING ALT. THEREAFTER; THE ACFT CLBED AND DSNDED IN VERY LARGE VARIATIONS. THE PFD SEEMED TO RAPIDLY FLICKER ON AND OFF AND AIRSPD WENT FROM THE 'LOW FOOT' RANGE TO WELL UP IN THE 'RED ZIPPER.' I HEARD THE OVERSPD WARNING ON AT LEAST 2 OR 3 OCCASIONS. THE MAX SPD I NOTED WAS APPROX 400 KIAS. WE WERE PULLING SIGNIFICANT G FORCES THROUGHOUT. WE NOTED VERY SIGNIFICANT ALT VARIATIONS. I BELIEVE THAT A MAYDAY WAS BROADCAST AND I DID ADVISE THE CTLR THAT WE WERE EXPERIENCING LOSS OF CTL. I DID NOT FEEL THAT WE WERE GETTING NORMAL ELEVATOR RESPONSE AND VERBALIZED THIS TO THE ARTCC CTLR. I RECALL THAT WE DECLARED AN EMER AT THAT TIME. AT THAT TIME; FO WAS ON THE CTLS AS WELL. I NOTED NUMEROUS LIGHTS ON THE EAD -- THE ONES I PARTICULARLY NOTED WERE 'RUDDER LIMITER FAILURE' AND EITHER 'CTL DISCONNECT' OR 'ELEVATOR DISCONNECT' AS WELL AS 'SELECT FADEC ALTERNATE.' WE THEN DECIDED TO LAND ASAP AT THE NEAREST SAFE ARPT. THE FO HAD SOLELY TAKEN OVER THE FLYING DUTIES WHEN I BEGAN WORKING WITH ATC TO FIND AN ARPT. I DID; HOWEVER; MANAGE THE PWR TO MAINTAIN AIRSPD AND WAS POSITIONED ON THE CTLS IN THE EVENT A PROB DEVELOPED. MANY OF THE EAD ALERTS I HAD OBSERVED EARLIER IN THE INCIDENT HAD APPARENTLY GONE OFF. CTL WAS NORMAL AS SLATS; FLAPS; AND GEAR WERE EXTENDED. LNDG WT WAS 100000 LBS. A DISCUSSION WITH THE CREW MEMBERS REVEALED THAT THE FLT ATTENDANTS HAD NOTED A 'BURNING' ODOR SHORTLY AFTER THE INCIDENT BEGAN. I BELIEVE THAT THEY INDICATED THAT PAX SEATED IN THE FORWARD PART OF THE CABIN REMARKED ACCORDINGLY. I DID NOT NOTICE ANY SUCH ODOR. I EXPERIENCED A LIGHTNING STRIKE IN A B717 WITHIN THE LAST 2 MONTHS AND DID NOT NOTE ANY SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS DURING THIS INCIDENT.

ANTICIPATING INSTRUCTIONS TO TURN ONTO RWY 27R TO EXIT THE RWY; I CONTINUED TO SLOW DOWN. WHEN NO INSTRUCTIONS WERE ISSUED; I LOOKED AT THE RWY HOLD SHORT LIGHTS FLASHING AND THOUGHT THERE MUST BE A REASON NOT TO TURN ONTO RWY 27R; AND I STOPPED AT THE HOLD SHORT LIGHTS. BY THE TIME I REALIZED I NEEDED TO JUST GET OFF THE RWY; MY HESITATION CAUSED THE ACFT BEHIND ME TO GO AROUND. ALTHOUGH CONTINUING ACROSS RWY 27R AND EXITING AT TXWY R WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE; I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE INTIMIDATED BY THE RWY HOLD SHORT LIGHTS. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 657917: THE APCH; LNDG; TOUCHDOWN; AND ROLLOUT WERE NORMAL. AS THE PLANE DECELERATED; I SWITCHED TO MANUAL BRAKING AND THEN SENSED THAT THE CAPT WAS BRAKING ALONG WITH ME. BECAUSE OF THIS; AT THE 60 KTS CALL; I SAID 'YOU GOT IT;' AND THE CAPT TOOK CTL OF THE ACFT. WE HAD DECELERATED ENOUGH SO THAT WE COULD EASILY MAKE THE TXWY R TURNOFF. BUT THE CAPT KEPT BRAKING AND WE GOT SLOWER AND SLOWER. AS I REALIZED WE WERE SLOWING ALMOST TO A STOP; I WAS ABOUT TO ASK HIM WHY; BUT THE TWR BEAT ME TO IT; YELLING; 'ACR XXXX WHY ARE YOU STOPPING ON THE RWY?!?!?! GET OFF THE RWY; TURN L; R ON RWY 27.' AT LEAST I THINK THOSE WERE THE INSTRUCTIONS; BUT I'M NOT SURE. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT; TWR TOLD THE AIRPLANE BEHIND US ON APCH TO GO AROUND. ALL I COULD THINK AT THAT TIME WAS THAT THEY WERE ALSO LNDG AND TAKING OFF ON RWY 27; TWR DIDN'T WANT US ON RWY 27; DID HE? WAS THE HURRIED CLRNC TO TURN L; NO R; ONTO RWY 27? THAT WAS COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED AND ENDED UP IN THE 'DOES NOT COMPUTE' FILE OF MY BRAIN; AND PROBABLY THE CAPT'S; TOO. I AM GUESSING THAT TWR SAID THIS JUST TO TRY TO GET US CLR OF THE RWY BY ANY MEANS POSSIBLE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT ALSO THAT TWR DID NOT GIVE US RWY EXIT INSTRUCTIONS ON LNDG; UNTIL HE STARTED YELLING AT US. I HAVE TO PRESUME THAT TWR THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO EXIT AT TXWY R THE WAY MOST ACFT LNDG RWY 22R DO.

THIS TYPE OF FLT IS FREQUENTLY MADE ABOVE FL180 BY ENTERING A 'WAVE WINDOW' SET UP UNDER A LETTER OF AGREEMENT WITH CTR AND OPENED ON AN 'AS-NEEDED' BASIS. WE MADE THE REQUEST TO CTR TO OPEN THE WINDOW WHEN WE WERE AT APPROX 15000 FT AND CLBING; AND CTR ASKED US TO HOLD FOR 30 MINS BELOW FL180 WHILE THEY CLRED TFC OUT OF THE WAVE WINDOW. HOLDING IN WAVE INVOLVES MATCHING AIRSPEED WITH WIND SPEED TO MAINTAIN POS AND USING LIFT-CANCELING DEVICES (SPOILERS) TO PREVENT FURTHER CLB. DURING OUR 30 MIN HOLD I BELIEVE THE WIND SPD INCREASED; PUSHING US FURTHER DOWNWIND (BACKWARDS). I THINK THE STATIONARY CLOUDS IN FRONT OF AND BEHIND US ALSO GREW IN SIZE; ALTHOUGH I DID NOT TAKE NOTE OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AT THE TIME. AFTER THE 30 MIN HOLD WE RESUMED OUR CLB AND WERE ENVELOPED VERY QUICKLY AT ABOUT 23500 FT BY THE CLOUD BEHIND US. I TOOK CTL FROM THE STUDENT AND IMMEDIATELY PICKED UP THE SPEED TO SEE IF WE COULD FLY FORWARD OUT OF THE CLOUD BUT WAITED ONLY A FEW SECONDS BEFORE DECIDING THAT WE WERE AT RISK OF BECOMING DISORIENTED AND ENTERING A DANGEROUS FLT REGIME WITHOUT OUTSIDE REFERENCE OR INSTRUMENTS FOR IFR FLT. PART OF WHAT PROMPTED MY CONCERN WAS HAVING READ NTSB RPTS OF PEOPLE BECOMING DISORIENTED INSIDE OF A MIN AND ENTERING A DEATH SPIRAL. I DID NOT WANT TO RISK SUCH AN EVENTUALITY; SO RESORTED TO THE 'BENIGN SPIRAL MODE;' A MANEUVER THE MANUFACTURER OF THIS MODEL OF GLIDER RECOMMENDS AS A MEANS TO MAKE A STABILIZED DESCENT WITHOUT TOUCHING THE CTLS. THIS MANEUVER CALLS FOR THE PLT TO PULL THE TRIM FULL AFT AND TO PULL ON FULL SPOILERS; THEN ALLOW THE GLIDER TO DESCEND WITHOUT TOUCHING THE CTLS. THE GLIDER DESCENDED IN A BENIGN SPIRAL FOR A LITTLE OVER 5 MINS; BREAKING OUT BELOW THE CLOUDS AT ABOUT 11000 FT MSL (APPROX 6500 FT AGL). I KNEW IN ADVANCE THAT CLOUD BASE WAS SUFFICIENTLY HIGH THAT WE WOULD BREAK OUT WELL ABOVE THE GND. IN RETROSPECT I SHOULD HAVE PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE POS OF THE AIRPLANE RELATIVE TO THE STATIONARY CLOUD BEHIND ME; AS I BELIEVE THE WIND SPEED INCREASED DURING OUR HOLD BELOW FL180. I SHOULD ALSO HAVE ENCOURAGED THE STUDENT PLT TO FLY FURTHER OUT INTO THE GAP BETWEEN THE STATIONARY CLOUDS; AN UPWIND MOVE THAT WOULD HAVE KEPT US FURTHER FROM THE CLOUD BEHIND US.

THE WX RPTED AT PAO WAS CEILING BROKEN AT 3000 FT; VISIBILITY 30 MI; WIND CALM. ABOUT 10 MI AFTER PASSING SNS; I DECIDED TO REQUEST A POP-UP IFR CLRNC TO PAO; BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING DARK AND I WAS NOT SURE I COULD FIND A HOLE TO DSND VFR TO PAO. I RECEIVED THE IFR CLRNC ABOUT 10 MI FROM DOCAL INTXN; WHILE AT 5000 FT -- LOWER WAS NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO CLOUDS. I WAS CLRED FOR THE APCH ABOUT 2 MI FROM DOCAL INTXN WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO CROSS DOCAL INTXN AT OR ABOVE 4400 FT. SHORTLY AFTER CROSSING DOCAL INTXN; I ENTERED IMC. THE NEXT STEP DOWN WAYPOINT IS ACHOZ AT 3500 FT AND 3 MI FROM DOCAL AND LATER PUDBY AT 200 FT AND 5 MI FROM ACHOZ. I ENTERED THE RIGHT ALTS AND VERT SPD IN AUTOPLT WHILE CROSSING DOCAL; BUT IT TOOK ME LONGER THAN NECESSARY; THEREFORE I STARTED MY DSCNT WITH SOME DELAY. FURTHERMORE; I DIDN'T REDUCE THE PWR ENOUGH; CONSEQUENTLY MY AIRSPEED WAS TOO HIGH. WITH THAT IN MIND; I WAS CONCERNED TO BE MUCH TOO HIGH IN MY DSCNT AND I INCREASED VERT SPD. I BROKE OUT OF IMC AT ABOUT 2700 FT AND IMMEDIATELY LOOKED AND CHKED WERE THE ARPT WAS; BUT DIDN'T REDUCE MY VERT SPD AND DIDN'T LEVEL OFF BEFORE REACHING PUDBY. BECAUSE OF THAT; I BELIEVE I CROSSED PUDBY AT ABOUT 1500 FT; WELL BELOW MINIMUM ALT OF 2000 FT. I THINK THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ERROR WAS NOT ENOUGH EXPERIENCE IN THE ACTUAL IMC. I HAVE 60 HRS SIMULATED AND ONLY 12 HRS ACTUAL IMC. MOST OF THE ACTUAL IMC WAS WITH AN INSTRUCTOR AND THIS WAS MY FIRST IFR APCH IN ACTUAL CONDITIONS; AT NIGHT; WITH MY FAMILY WITH ME. ALTHOUGH THE WX WAS BENIGN; THIS CREATED A STRESS SUCH THAT; WHEN I BROKE OFF IMC; I MENTALLY ASSUMED TO BE UNDER VFR AND JUST CONTINUED MY DSCNT. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1) DECISION TO POSTPONE REQUESTING IFR CLRNC; WHICH LEFT ME WITH LESS TIME TO REVIEW AND PREPARE FOR THE APCH. 2) FORGETTING TO REDUCE THE SPD; WHICH WOULD GIVE ME MORE TIME FOR THE DSCNT.

THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR PROPERTY DAMAGE AND THE ONLY DAMAGE TO THE ACFT WAS A BROKEN POS LIGHT ON THE L WINGTIP. THE CAUSE OF THE PWR LOSS WAS DETERMINED TO BE FUEL EXHAUSTION. I BELIEVE THE CAUSE OF THE FUEL EXHAUSTION WAS A COMBINATION OF IMPROPER LEANING PROCS THAT LED TO EXCESSIVE FUEL CONSUMPTION IN COMBINATION WITH A GROSSLY INACCURATE L FUEL GAUGE WHICH LED ME TO BELIEVE I HAD ENOUGH FUEL TO LAND AT ZZZ3 WITH LEGAL FUEL RESERVES. I DEPARTED ZZZ1 WITH 1 PVT PLT/PAX. WE FLEW TO ZZZ2 TO PICK UP 2 PAX FOR CHARITABLE MEDICAL AIR TRANSPORTATION. I USE DUATS FLT PLANNER AND HAVE THE FUEL BURN SET FOR 9.5 GPH. THE FLT PLANNER CALCULATED THE FLT FROM ZZZ2 TO ZZZ3 TO TAKE 2 HRS 42 MINS AND REQUIRE 26 GALLONS OF FUEL. GOOD VMC WAS FORECAST AT ZZZ2 FOR MY TIME OF ARR AND I DECIDED I COULD DEPART WITH THE FUEL THAT WAS ON BOARD AND STILL LAND WITH 1 HR OF FUEL REMAINING. THIS WAS MY FIRST MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK THE CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT LED TO FUEL EXHAUSTION. WHEN I SAW THAT I HAD LESS FUEL IN THE TANKS THAN EXPECTED; I SHOULD HAVE ORDERED MORE FUEL. I ALSO SHOULD HAVE GIVEN SOME THOUGHT AS TO WHY I DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH FUEL AS EXPECTED AFTER TAKING ON THE 10 GALLONS AS PLANNED. DURING THE ACFT'S RECENT ANNUAL INSPECTION; A CYLINDER HAD TO BE REPLACED AND THE MECH STATED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE DAMAGED FROM OVER-LEANING. HE ADVISED THE FLYING CLUB'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT PLTS NEEDED TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVER-LEAN THE ENG. I TOOK HIS ADVICE OUT OF CONTEXT AND LEANED TO A SETTING RELATIVELY RICH COMPARED TO THE NORMAL 50 DEGS RICH OF PEAK EGT SETTING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS USED IN THE PAST. WHILE I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THE FUEL BURN CALCULATIONS I USE DURING PREFLT PLANNING WOULD NOT BE ACCURATE IF I DIDN'T USE THE SAME RECOMMENDED LEANING PROCS I HAD ALWAYS USED IN THE PAST; I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED THE DIFFERENCE IN FUEL CONSUMPTION WOULD BE 3 GPH AS IT TURNED OUT TO BE. I HAD DEPARTED ZZZ2 ON THE L FUEL TANK. I SET A TIMER FOR 1 HR AND SWITCHED TO THE R TANK WHEN THE TIMER WENT OFF. I SET THE TIMER TO 1 HR 30 MINS FOR THE R TANK. WITH 3 MINS REMAINING ON THE TIMER; THE R FUEL TANK RAN OUT OF FUEL. I SWITCHED TO THE L TANK IMMEDIATELY. THE R TANK SHOULD HAVE HAD 25-30 MINS OF FUEL REMAINING AT THE TIME THE TANK RAN DRY. AFTER SWITCHING TO THE L TANK; I CHKED THE GAUGE AND IT SHOWED 15 GALLONS REMAINING. I ESTIMATED I WOULD LAND WITH 1 HR OF FUEL REMAINING AS EXPECTED. THE PLT/PAX SITTING IN THE R FRONT SEAT STATED HE TOO SAW THAT THE GAUGE WAS READING 15 GALLONS REMAINING ON THE L TANK. AT THIS TIME; I SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT THE GAUGE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE CORRECT. HAD I REALIZED THAT I COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE 15 GALLONS REMAINING IN THE L TANK; I WOULD HAVE DIVERTED TO NEARBY ZZZ4 FOR FUEL. THIS; OF COURSE; WAS ANOTHER LINK IN THE CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN BROKEN. APPROX 30 MINS LATER; WHILE ON THE LAST VECTOR TO INTERCEPT THE LOC FOR RWY 16 (CIRCLE TO LAND RWY 30); THE ENG BEGAN LOSING PWR. I WAS AT 2500 FT MSL AND APPROX 6.5 MI FROM ZZZ3. I DECLARED AN EMER AND ADVISED THE CTLR THAT I COULDN'T MAINTAIN ALT AND WAS LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO LAND. I IMMEDIATELY LOOKED AT THE L FUEL GAUGE AND IT SHOWED IT HAD 10 GALLONS OF FUEL REMAINING. I BRIEFLY BEGAN TROUBLESHOOTING INCLUDING CARB HEAT; L FUEL TANK SELECTED; MIXTURE AND THROTTLE FORWARD. I WAS IN A POPULATED AREA AND QUICKLY ABANDONED THE EFFORT TO RESTORE PWR SO I COULD FLY THE PLANE AND FIND A PLACE TO LAND. I LANDED ON A NEW ROAD ADJACENT TO A SUBDIVISION THAT HAD NOT YET BEEN OPENED AND WAS BARRICADED AT THE FAR END. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A FUEL LEAK TO EXPLAIN THE HIGH RATE OF FUEL CONSUMPTION. THE ACFT WAS DISMANTLED AND TRAILERED BACK TO ZZZ3 FOR REASSEMBLY. IN HINDSIGHT; WHEN THE TANK RAN DRY UNEXPECTEDLY WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE HAD 30 MINS OF FUEL AVAILABLE; I SHOULD HAVE DIVERTED ANYWAY. I HAD NEVER RUN ANY FUEL TANK DRY IN THE 13 YRS I'VE BEEN FLYING PRIOR TO THIS FLT.

THE CREW WROTE UP A SIGNIFICANT VIBRATION IN THE TAIL DURING CLBOUT. I MET WITH THE LEAD AND THE MECHS AND PROCEEDED TO EVALUATE THE ACFT. WHEN I DEBRIEFED THE CREW; THEY SAID THEY HAD A MOMENTARY VIBRATION FELT IN THE AFT GALLEY AND ON THE FLT DECK. I WENT TO THE MAINT MANUAL; AND REVIEWED MAINT TIPS. I MISTAKENLY MISREAD THE TROUBLESHOOTING TREE AND FELT THE PROB POINTED TO A BAD BODY FAIRING SEAL (A KNOWN AND REGULAR PROB WITH AIRBUS). MY MISTAKE OCCURRED IN READING TIP WHICH STATES 'AFT CABIN OR FORWARD AND AFT CABINS' - BUT I READ 'AFT CABIN OR FORWARD CABINS.' SINCE THE PROB WAS IN THE FLT DECK AND THE AFT GALLEY; I DISMISSED THIS AS BEING ANOTHER BAD SEAL. I CONFERRED WITH THE OUTBOUND CREW WHO WERE OK WITH THE DEFERRAL PROCESS. UPON RETURNING TO WORK; I REVIEWED ACFT X AND WAS HORRIFIED TO SEE IT OTS FOR AIRFRAME VIBRATION!

I OBSERVED A NUMBER OF FLTS BEING LOADED AS WELL AS RAMP'S ACTIONS TO UPDATE THE COMPUTER TO PROVIDE CLOSEOUT INFO TO CENTRALIZED LOAD PLANNING. IT WAS RAINING AT SFO AND RAMP WAS HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME KEEPING UP WITH DELAYED FLTS. I OBSERVED A HAZMAT SHIPMENT SCHEDULED TO BE LOADED ONTO A FLT HELD OFF THE FLT DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS (ONLY BAGS WERE LOADED). I THEN BOARDED FLT TO YYY. BECAUSE THE FLT WAS FULL; I SPENT THE FLT IN THE COCKPIT. UPON ENTERING THE COCKPIT AND BEFORE PUSHBACK; I NOTICED THAT A DANGEROUS GOODS 'YES' NOTATION APPEARED ON THE CENTRALIZED LOAD PLANNING PAPERWORK. I ASKED THE CREW IF THEY HAD RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION FORM FOR DANGEROUS GOODS; AND THEY REPLIED THAT THEY HAD NOT. NONE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DELIVERED. BECAUSE OF THE WX AND WHAT I HAD PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED; I ASSUMED THE SHIPMENT HAD BEEN HELD OFF THE ACFT. UPON ARR; I OBTAINED A COPY OF THE FINALIZED CONTAINER MANIFEST. THE CONTAINER MANIFEST SHOWED THAT A DANGEROUS GOODS SHIPMENT (DRY ICE) HAD BEEN BOARDED INTO PIT 21; A FINAL DEST OF YYY AND A TOTAL WT OF 1043 LBS. THE CODE HAD BEEN PROPERLY FILLED OUT AND REFLECTED 'ICE.' I THEN MET WITH A RAMP LEAD AND PROCEEDED TO OBSERVE THE UNLOADING OF THE ACFT. A CONTAINER WAS REMOVED FROM PIT 21 AND OPENED. INSIDE WERE TWO WOODEN SHIPMENTS; EACH WITH A CLASS 9 LABEL. CONTRARY TO DOT AND ICAO REQUIREMENTS; THERE WERE NO LABELS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTAINER. ATTACHED TO ONE OF THE SHIPMENTS WAS AN UNOPENED POUCH CONTAINING 2 SETS OF PARTIALLY COMPLETED PLT NOTIFICATION FORMS. THE 'AIR WAYBILL NUMBER' AND 'PREPARED BY' SEGMENTS OF THE FORM INDICATED THAT THE SHIPMENT HAD BEEN ACCEPTED IN YMML BY A DANGEROUS GOODS SPECIALIST. THE FIRST NOTIFICATION FORM WAS FOR A FLT FROM YSSY TO XXX. IT WAS UNCLEAR HOW THE SHIPMENT TRAVELED BETWEEN YMML AND YSSY. THE PORTIONS OF THE FORM FOR CONTAINER/CART NUMBER; LOADING LOCATION; AND THE CONTAINER LOADED AND ACFT LOADED SIGNATURE BLOCKS WERE BLANK FOR THE YSSY TO XXX FORM. THERE WAS ALSO A FORM FOR A SFO-YYY SEGMENT WITH THE IDENTICAL SECTIONS BLANK; AND ALSO NOTHING FILLED IN FOR FLT/DATE. THE REST OF THE FORM WAS COMPLETED CORRECTLY; INCLUDING THE INDICATION THAT THERE WERE 2 SHIPMENTS OF DRY ICE; EACH WITH A WT OF 66 LBS. IN SUMMARY; IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE WAS NO PLT NOTIFICATION FOR THESE TWO FLTS. THERE MAY HAVE BEEN NO NOTIFICATION FOR A YMML-YSSY SEGMENT. ADDITIONALLY; THERE WAS NO LABELING ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTAINER ON THE YSSY/XXX LEG.

DURING OUR SEVERAL STEPS OF CLBOUT OF ZZZ UP TO OUR CRUISE ALT OF FL360; WE NOTICED SEVERAL TIMES THE AUTOPLT WAS NOT AS PRECISE IN LEVELING OFF THE ACFT AS WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO. THESE MINOR UNDER-/OVERSHOOTS WERE MAYBE 50 FT OFF. THIS WAS NOT NORMAL TO ME. WITH OVER 4000 HRS IN THE B737 IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE AUTOPLT TRIM MOTOR WAS MAYBE NOT WORKING AS MUCH AS I NORMALLY SEE. AFTER OUR INITIAL LEVELOFF IN CRUISE; THE AUTOPLT AND ALT HOLD WORKED NORMALLY FOR THE FO AND HELD OUR ASSIGNED FL360 WELL USING THE 'B' AUTOPLT. AT APPROX XA00Z; WHILE FLYING; WE NOTICED THE ALT HOLD WAS STARTING TO NOT HOLD THE ACFT ALT AS PRECISELY. THE ACFT WAS NOW HOLDING FL360 +/-100 FT WITH A COUPLE MOMENTARY 'STABILIZER OUT OF TRIM' LIGHT ON. AUTOPLT 'A' WAS ALSO TRIED AND NO HELP. THE FO AND I AGREED THAT A MAINT WRITE-UP SHOULD BE MADE ON THIS. I COMMUNICATED TO MAINT CTLR VIA ACARS USING TEXT MESSAGES TO DESCRIBE OUR OBSERVATIONS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE ACFT HAD PREVIOUS HISTORY ON THIS PROB NOTED IN OUR PAPERWORK SO WE MADE NUMEROUS AND DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS TO MAINT CTLR AS TO THE BEHAVIOR OF THE AUTOPLT AND TRIM SYS TO HELP IN THEIR TROUBLESHOOTING NOTES. IN SUMMARY; IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE AUTOPLT TRIM MOTOR WAS DELAYED IN GETTING INPUTS TO THE STABILIZER TRIM AND THEN MOVED LESS THAN WHAT APPEARED TO BE NEEDED. AFTER RPTING TO MAINT CTLR ALL OUR DETAILS; THE AUTOPLT THEN SETTLED DOWN AND OPERATED NORMALLY AGAIN. AS WE APCHED TOP OF DSCNT WITH THE ALT HOLD STILL ON; THE ACFT STARTED A GENTLE CLB UP AWAY FROM OUR ASSIGNED ALT. THE FO DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT AT ABOUT 100 FT HIGH; TRIMMED THE PITCH DOWN NORMALLY WITH THE YOKE TRIM SWITCH AND STARTED OUR DSCNT INTO ZZZ1. THE FO FLEW A NORMAL HAND-FLOWN DSCNT TO LNDG AT ZZZ1. AT THE GATE IN ZZZ1; TALKING WITH MAINT ABOUT OUR WRITE-UP; WE NOTICED THAT THE TRIM WHEEL WAS NOW 'LOCKED' AND WE WERE UNABLE TO MOVE THE TRIM WHEELS BY HAND. POSTFLT; AS WE DISCUSSED THE VARIOUS SYMPTOMS; IT NOW SEEMS THAT THE STABILIZER TRIM BECAME SO BADLY JAMMED OR DAMAGED DURING OUR FLT; THAT THE AUTOPLT TRIM MOTOR (LOW VOLT; LOW PWR) WAS UNABLE TO MOVE THE STABILIZER TRIM AND MAY HAVE BURNED OUT. IF WE HAD NEEDED TO MANUALLY MOVE THE TRIM; IT TOO WAS LOCKED AND BEYOND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE MANUAL INPUTS. UNKNOWN TO US AT THE TIME INFLT; THE ONLY TRIM WE HAD AVAILABLE TO US WAS THE NORMAL TRIM ON THE YOKE (HIGH VOLT; HIGH PWR) AND THIS MOTOR WAS APPARENTLY WORKING VERY HARD TO GET THE JAMMED OR DAMAGED STABILIZER TRIM SYS TO MOVE AS WE NEEDED. DEPENDENT ON THE ACTUAL FINDINGS OF MAINT; IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WITH TIME; THE MAIN TRIM MOTOR COULD HAVE FAILED. ALSO; WE MAY HAVE HAD SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE STABILIZER TRIM SYS INCLUDING THE JACK SCREW DURING OUR FLT TO ZZZ1 WHEN USING THE MAIN TRIM MOTOR. I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY FEEDBACK AS TO THE FINDINGS BY MAINT OF THE STABILIZER TRIM SYS OF THIS ACFT. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS: 1) WHAT APPEARED TO BE A MINOR PROB WITH THE AUTOPLT SYS WAS ACTUALLY A SERIOUS STABILIZER TRIM SYS PROB(S). 2) SINCE THE ACFT HAD A PREVIOUS HISTORY OF THIS 'AUTOPLT PROB;' THE ACFT FLEW MULTIPLE LEGS WITH THIS PENDING STABILIZER PROB. 3) ON MY DRIVE HOME; I REMEMBERED 2 ACFT LOST DUE TO IMPROPER TRIM SETTINGS AND/OR STABILIZER TRIM FAILURES.

I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT WHILE HAVING A VERY GOOD GRIP ON THE YOKE AND THE ACFT STARTED A RAPID ASCENT THAT I COULDN'T COUNTERACT. WITH THE YOKE PUSHED FULL FORWARD; I PULLED THE THROTTLES TO FLT IDLE AND NOTICED THE FLAP CTL LEVER NOT IN THE FULL 'UP' POS. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED FOR FULL UP ON THE FLAPS AND WAS ABLE TO GAIN POSITIVE CTL OF THE ACFT AGAIN. ALL OF THIS PROBABLY TRANSPIRED IN ABOUT 45 SECONDS TO A MIN. DURING THE EVENT; WE NOTIFIED THE CTLR THAT WE MAY HAVE TO RETURN TO PIT AS WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND INFORMED HIM OF A TRIM PROB. AS SOON AS THE FLAP SWITCH WAS MADE AND THE ACFT SLOWED BELOW 200 KTS; THE TAIL STARTED TO MOVE INTO THE HIGH SPD POS AND IT WAS APPARENT WHAT THE PROB WAS. WITH THE THROTTLES IN THE CLB POS; THEY PARTLY OBSCURE THE FLAP HANDLE POS. THE ONLY THING I CAN IMAGINE HAPPENED IS THAT WHEN I CALLED FOR FLAPS UP AFTER TKOF; THE PNF MOVED THE FLAP CTL; BUT BECAUSE OF THE TURB WE WERE EXPERIENCING; IT DIDN'T QUITE MAKE IT AGAINST THE SWITCH. THE CITATION 560XLS HAS A MOVEABLE ELEVATOR FOR HIGH SPD AND LOW SPD FLT. IT TAKES ITS POS FROM THE FLAP CTL HANDLE BEING FULL UP FOR HIGH SPD. WHILE IN THE CLB I HAD NO INDICATION OF A PROB BECAUSE OF CLBING OUT AT A SLOWER SPD DUE TO THE TURB. THE FIRST TIME WE EXCEEDED 200 KTS WAS WHEN I LEVELED OFF. THE ACFT WILL NOT EXCEED THE AUTOPLT TRIM LIMITS UNTIL ACCELERATING PAST 200 KTS. THE CORRECTIVE ACTION IS TO VERIFY THAT THE TAIL IS MOVING AFTER FLAP RETRACTION BY VERIFYING THE HYD PRESSURE ANNUNCIATOR LIGHT IS ILLUMINATED. THIS PROC IS TAUGHT IN TRAINING AND OBVIOUSLY FOR GOOD REASON. WITH THE ADDED DISTR OF TURB AND WX IT SHOWS HOW EASY IT IS NOT TO NOTICE THE ABSENCE OF THE ANNUNCIATOR LIGHT. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATED THAT THE CESSNA 560 XLS THROTTLE QUADRANT DESIGN ALLOWS THE THROTTLE HANDLES TO BLOCK THE FLAP HANDLE AND FLAP POSITION INDICATOR. ADDITIONALLY; WHEN THE FLAP HANDLE IS IN THE FULL RETRACT POSITION; THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER HYDRAULICALLY MOVES THREE DEGREES FOR HIGH SPEED FLIGHT. ABOVE 200 KTS THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER CANNOT MOVE AND THE STAB TRIM IS FROZEN. THEREFORE IF THE FLAP HANDLE IS NOT UP; THE ACFT MUST BE SLOWED AND THE HANDLE SELECTED UP. THE ACFT IS UNCONTROLLABLE AND PITCHES UP ABOVE 200 KTS WITH THE FLAPS OUT. THE FAA SPENT TIME WITH THIS ACR AND PLT INVESTIGATING THE CONFIGURATION. THIS PLT BELIEVES A LIGHT ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL INDICATING FLAP HANDLE NOT IN THE UP POSITION AND A SPEED OF 190 KTS OR GREATER WOULD ALLOW THE CREW TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION BEFORE THIS SITUATION DEVELOPS.

FO HAD THE FIELD IN SIGHT SINCE IT WAS ON HIS SIDE OF ACFT. APCH CTLR MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT MACDILL AFB IN HIS APCH CLRNC WHICH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND. THE FO HAD NOT HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT MACDILL SO I ASKED HIM TO ASK THE APCH CTLR TO CLARIFY. APCH SAID 'STAY AT 2600 FT UNTIL YOU'RE W OF MACDILL.' I THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SAID 'N OF MACDILL' THE FIRST TIME. SO; AGAIN; I WAS UNSURE. SO I ASKED THE FO TO ASK THE CTLR 'WE ARE UNFAMILIAR; CAN WE TURN THE BASE LEG HERE?' THE CTLR SAID 'AFFIRMATIVE' SO WE STARTED THE TURN AND THE DSCNT TO JOIN THE FINAL ON THE GLIDE PATH. WHILE ON THE BASE LEG; WE LOST THE ARPT IN THE EARLY MORNING SUNLIGHT; HAZE; AND A DEVELOPING CLOUD COVER. I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE CONTINUING A VISUAL APCH; SO I ASKED THE FO TO REQUEST VECTORS AROUND FOR THE ILS. AT THIS SAME TIME; THE CTLR CHASTISED US FOR DSNDING BELOW 2600 FT. THERE WAS NO POINT IN ARGUING; SO WE AGAIN ASKED FOR VECTORS FOR THE APCH. HE SAID THAT WE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED HIS CLRNC 3 TIMES; WHICH IS DEFINITELY NOT EITHER OF OUR RECOLLECTIONS. I KNEW OUR PROX TO MACDILL BECAUSE I BRIEFED ITS LOCATION TO TPA IN MY APCH BRIEF. I ALWAYS BRIEF OTHER ARPTS IN THE VICINITY TO AVOID LNDG AT THE WRONG ARPT. APCH CTLR WAS BUSY DEALING WITH AN ACFT ON AN EMER INBOUND TO TPA. HE WAS TRYING TO GET US IN BEFORE THE EMER ACFT. WE WERE IN NO HURRY BECAUSE WE WERE LNDG. IN FACT; WE HAD SLOWED TO .70 MACH IN CRUISE TO SAVE FUEL SINCE WE WERE SO EARLY. AFTER TALKING WITH FELLOW COMPANY PLTS; THEY INFORMED ME THAT TPA APCH WANTS ACFT ABOVE 2600 FT BEFORE N OF MACDILL AFB. IT SEEMS TO BE WELL-KNOWN TO PLTS FLYING IN AND OUT OF TPA. MY RECOMMENDATION TO CORRECT THIS WOULD BE TO CREATE A 'VISUAL APCH; RWY 36L' CHART FOR VISUAL APCHS TO RWY 36L WITH THE MACDILL 2600 FT RESTR CHARTED FOR ALL TO SEE AND BRIEF. ATC'S AMBIGUOUS CLRNC TO STAY AT 2600 FT UNTIL N OF MACDILL DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BECAUSE WE WERE N OF MACDILL. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE: 1) ATC'S HVY WORKLOAD IN DEALING WITH AN INBOUND EMER ACFT. 2) ATC'S VAGUE CLRNC WITH AN ALT RESTR THAT IS ESOTERIC AT BEST. 3) WORSENING WX CONDITIONS THAT DISTR THE FLT CREW AS WE DISCUSSED THE NEED TO DISCONTINUE THE VISUAL APCH. 4) THE FLT CREW'S UNFAMILIARITY WITH TPA'S PROCS THAT INVOLVE NONSTANDARD VISUALS. AGAIN; I'D LIKE TO REITERATE THE NEED FOR A CHARTERED VISUAL APCH FOR THAT RWY. STAYING AS HIGH ON A VISUAL APCH WHERE THERE ARE NO MOUNTAINS OR SIMILAR OBSTRUCTIONS IS COUNTER-INTUITIVE.

WE ACQUIRED THE TFC ON TCASII AND PNF RESPONDED TO ATC; 'WE HAVE HIM ON TCASII.' SOMEWHERE AROUND 7000 FT IN THE DSCNT; TCASII UPGRADED TO A TA. EVEN THOUGH I WAS HIGH FOR THE APCH; REDUCED MY DSCNT RATE TO AVOID AN RA. WE WERE IN IMC DSNDING THROUGH THE HAZE AND CLOUD LAYER. WE NEVER VISUALLY ACQUIRED THE VFR TFC; BUT CONTINUED TO WATCH HIM ON TCASII. THE TFC WAS CONVERGING WITH US BOTH IN THE HORIZ AND VERT SENSE; SO I LEVELED OFF AT 6200 FT AND PREPARED MENTALLY FOR AN RA. JUST AFTER LEVELING OFF; TCASII UPGRADED TO A CLB RA. I SELECTED TOGA PWR AND PITCHED UP TO FOLLOW GUIDANCE. PNF ADVISED ATC OF OUR TCASII CLB AND GOT NO RESPONSE FROM ATC. I THEN PULLED THE PWR BACK TO MCT SINCE IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE WE NEEDED ALL THE PWR. ALMOST INSTANTLY; TCASII UPGRADED AGAIN TO INCREASE CLB. I WENT BACK TO TOGA AND INCREASED CLB RATE. WE WERE CLR OF CONFLICT AT AROUND 6800 FT. ATC THEN GAVE US FURTHER CLRNC TO DSND AND TO INTERCEPT THE LOC RWY 10L. FLT LANDED WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. ON THE GND; I EXPLAINED (VIA PHONE) WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CMH TRACON SUPVR. I WAS UPSET AT THE RA AND THE FACT THAT THE CTLR NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED OUR TCASII CLB. I THEN SPOKE WITH THE CTLR HIMSELF REGARDING THE TFC. HE SAID; 'BUT YOU SAID YOU HAD THE TFC ON TCASII?!' I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT HAVING THE TFC ON TCASII IS NOT THE SAME AS CALLING TFC IN SIGHT. I THINK HE THOUGHT HE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SEPARATION BY US STATING WE HAD THE TFC ON TCASII. THE TFC WAS A LIGHT VFR ACFT AND WAS NOT IN CONTACT WITH CMH APCH. HE EVIDENTLY OVERSHOT HIS TARGET ALT OF 5500 FT. IF HE WAS AT 5500 FT OR HIGHER; THERE WAS NO WAY HE WAS 500 FT BELOW THE CLOUD LAYER WE WERE IN.

WHEN THEY HANDED US OVER TO APCH CTL AT ABOUT 40 MILES OUT; THEY GAVE US A 150 DEG HDG TO JOIN THE ILS TO RWY 9R. I; AS THE PF; QUICKLY CHANGED THE APCH IN THE MCDU TO THE RWY 9R ILS AND RE-BRIEFED THE APCH. AS I WAS RE-BRIEFING THE APCH; I NOTICED THAT THE FREQ THAT WAS DISPLAYED ON MY PFD WAS NOT THE CORRECT FREQ OR THE CORRECT IDENTIFIER; ALTHOUGH THE WAYPOINTS WERE PROPERLY SEQUENCED. THE CAPT'S INFO ON HIS PFD WAS CORRECT. WE TRIED AGAIN TO RE-ENTER THE RWY 9R ILS IN THE MCDU AND RECYCLE THE ILS BUTTONS ON THE PFD CTL; BUT IT STILL SHOWED THE WRONG FREQ AND IDENTIFIER. APCH HAD DSNDED US NOW DOWN TO 4000 FT AND WE WERE JOINING ON ABOUT A 25 MILE FINAL SO I HAD THE ACFT MANAGED AND I LET IT JOIN VIA THE RNAV. AS WERE CLOSER IN ON THE APCH; THEY DSNDED US TO 3500 FT AND CLRED US FOR THE RWY 9R ILS. I THEN TRIED TO ENGAGE THE APPR PUSH BUTTON; BUT IT WOULD NOT ENGAGE. I TRIED SWITCHING AUTOPLTS AND THEN ENGAGING THE APPR PUSH BUTTON; BUT IT STILL WOULD NOT ENGAGE. WE HAD A QUICK DISCUSSION ABOUT A FLT DIRECTOR OFF APCH WITHOUT THE AUTOPLT; BUT WITH MY PFD NOT DISPLAYING THE CORRECT ILS INFO HE WOULD FLY THE APCH. I TURNED THE ACFT OVER TO THE CAPT FOR THE APCH AND ASKED IF HE WANTED THE LNDG GEAR AND THE LNDG CHK. WE PERFORMED THESE PROCS AND HE CONTINUED TO SHOOT THE APCH. I HAD A HARD TIME PERFORMING MY PNF DUTIES WITH NO ILS INFO ON MY PFD AND THE ACFT STARTED GOING L OF THE LOCALIZER. ATL APCH THEN CALLED US TO SEE IF WE HAD SWITCHED OVER TO TWR YET SO I ANSWERED THEM AND THEN SWITCHED OVER TO TWR. THE MOMENT WAS GETTING VERY TENSE AS I COULD NOT DO MY PNF DUTIES VERY WELL BY LOOKING OVER AT THE CAPT'S PFD. ATL TWR CLRED US TO LAND ON RWY 9R AND THEN INFORMED US WE WERE L OF THE LOCALIZER. A GO AROUND WAS THEN CALLED FOR BY THE CAPT DUE TO THE APCH BECOMING UNSTABLE AND L OF THE LOCALIZER AND THE GO AROUND PROCS WERE FOLLOWED. ATL TWR TURNED US TO A 180 DEG HDG AND WE WERE TOLD TO CLB AND MAINTAIN 3000 FT. WE WERE THEN HANDED OFF TO APCH AND I; AS THE PNF; CONTACTED DISPATCH TO PUT US THROUGH TO MAINT TO CONFER WITH THEM WHY I WAS NOT GETTING THE CORRECT LOCALIZER INFO ON MY PFD AND WHY THE APPR MODE WOULD NOT ENGAGE. I SPOKE WITH THEM FOR A BRIEF TIME WITH NO RESOLUTION. THE CAPT WAS TALKING TO APCH AND REQUESTED THE RWY 8R ILS. I THEN TOOK BACK CTL OF THE ACFT AND THE CAPT TALKED TO MAINT. I; AS THE PF; THEN DID A NORMAL ILS AND LNDG ON RWY 8L. WHEN WE GOT TO THE GATE; WE CALLED MAINT AGAIN TO DISCUSS THE ERROR ON MY PFD AND OUR BEING UNABLE TO ENGAGE THE APPR MODE. I FEEL OUR LAST MINUTE CHANGE IN FLYING ROLES AND OUR RUSHED DECISION MAKING ABOUT OUR NAVIGATIONAL PROB LED TO THIS UNSTABLE APCH. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE CHANGED ROLES AND SIMPLY PERFORMED A GO AROUND FROM 3500 FT AND HANDLED THE PROB. NEITHER OF US HAD SEEN A PROB LIKE THIS BEFORE. I ALSO FEEL FATIGUE AND A CHANGE IN OUR CIRCADIAN CYCLE ARE FACTORS IN OUR DECISION MAKING. THE PREVIOUS DAY WE HAD SHOWED AT XA:08 FOR A SIX LEG DAY; FOLLOWED BY A 21:00 HR ZZZ OVERNIGHT. ON THIS EVENING; WE SHOWED AT XJ:00 TO FLY TO LAS FOR A 3 HR BREAK TO DO A RED EYE TO ATL. I LEARNED MANY LESSONS ABOUT RUSH DECISION MAKING FROM THIS EVENT. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATED THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO TROUBLESHOOT THE ANOMALY ON THE GND BECAUSE THE SYSTEM RESETS ITSELF AFTER LNDG. THE MOST CONFUSING PORTION OF THE EVENT WAS THAT THE WAYPOINTS WERE CORRECTLY DISPLAYED ON THE MCDU AND PFD; BUT THE ILS FREQ WAS INCORRECT. IN FACT; THE ILS FOR THE INITIAL RWY SELECTION WAS OPERATIVE AND DID NOT RECYCLE TO THE NEW SELECTION.

DAILY; IF NOT BY HR AFTER HR; ARTCC CONTINUES TO ASSIGN ARRIVING OR OVERFLT ACFT INCORRECT FREQS. WE HAVE HAD SUPVRS TELL US THAT THE MAPS THAT ZME USED ARE VERY OUTDATED. I BELIEVE THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE DECADES OLD INFO. ACFT BEING SWITCHED TO THE WRONG FREQS SEEM TO BE A GAME BY ZME OR A TOTAL LACK OF RESPECT BY ZME. OUR TRACON COMBINES/DECOMBINES POS SEVERAL TIMES DAILY BASED ON LUNCH/DINNER PERIODS AND BTWN HVY PUSHES. ZME HAS USED THE EXCUSE THAT A 'LETTER' TELLS THEM TO USE THE INCORRECT FREQS OR THEY USE THE POS 'LETTER' OF THE TRACON POS THAT IS RECEIVING THE AUTOMATED RADAR HDOF. THIS IS ALSO AN EXCUSE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THIS CORRECT. SEVERAL TIMES DURING THIS WK WE HAVE HAD ACFT SWITCHED TO INCORRECT FREQS WHEN ALL POS ARE OPEN. NO EXCUSE FOR THIS OTHER THAN INCOMPETENCE OR A 'JUST DON'T CARE ATTITUDE.' SEVERAL TIMES WHEN POS HAVE BEEN 'SPLIT' ACFT ARE ON INCORRECT FREQS AND HAVE RECEIVED POOR SVC. LATE TURN ON TO THE LOCALIZERS; OR ACFT NOT BEING COM XFERRED TO ZME FOR DEPS AND OVERFLTS. THIS ALSO MAKES FOR ACFT BEING ON INCORRECT FREQS IN ANOTHER CTLR'S AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY. WE XFER COMS TO THE CORRECT FREQS NO MATTER WHAT SECTOR WITHIN ZME IS COMBINED. ZME MUST DO THE SAME. I CAN EASILY SEE AN OPDEV OR OPERROR BEING CAUSED BY INCORRECT FREQ ASSIGNMENTS. THIS HAPPENS ALL DAY LONG EVERY DAY. JUN/MON/05; SEVERAL TIMES WORKING ARR TFC FROM ZME CONCERNING HVY JET TFC; THE LEADING HVY WILL SLOW ON THEIR OWN OR SLOW WHEN INSTRUCTED BY THE ARR'S CTLRS FOR DSCNT AND THE TRAILING HVY WHICH IS NOT 10 MI IN TRAIL AND 'GOING' FAST WILL CLOSE UP TO AND LOSE REQUIRED MINIMUM WAKE TURB SEPARATION. I HAD TO SLOW A TRAILING HVY ACFT WHILE IN ZME AIRSPACE SO AS NOT TO LOSE ANY RADAR SEPARATION; MUCH LESS THAT MINIMUM RADAR SEPARATION. THIS HAPPENS DAILY AND WITH ALL TYPES OF JET ACFT. ZME USES METHODS THAT INCLUDE HAVING THE LEADING ACFT TO GO FAST BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO SET A SEQUENCE 'AT THE ARR GATE.' THIS IS TOO CLOSE AND RESULTS IN ACFT BEING STACKED INSTEAD OF BEING PLACED IN-TRAIL AT AN ACCEPTABLE SPD. ZME ALWAYS CALLS AND REQUESTS OUR APPROVAL FOR THIS AS THEIR USUAL 'OUT.' THIS USUALLY HAPPENS ON THE 'SHORT' BASE LEG SIDE WHICH 'JAMS' THE ARR CTLRS WHO HAVE TO 'TERROR VECTOR' TO GAIN REQUIRED SPACING TO THE FINAL CTLRS. THIS IS HARD TO DO ESPECIALLY WITH HVY ACFT. THIS AFTERNOON; THE MKL SECTOR FED ME JET ACFT DSNDING TO 10000 FT IN EXCESS OF 320 KTS ON THE SHORT SIDE. WE HAVE ABOUT 15 MI TO SLOW DOWN AND GET DOWN TO FEED THE FINAL CTRS. ZME AS A METHOD WILL NOT SWITCH FREQS TO US UNTIL THE BOUNDARY OF OUR AIRSPACE. WE WILL GET THESE ACFT BEING INSTRUCTED TO GO 'FAST' AND WILL COM WITH US AROUND 30-35 MI OUT FROM THE CTR OF OUR ARPT. TRANSLATION -- THE ACFT HAVE TO BE VECTORED TO SLOW DOWN AND GET DOWN. VERY POOR METHODOLOGY BY ZME AND ALL SECTORS USE THIS. THIS METHOD OF TFC MGMNT BY ALL SECTORS THAT FEED US IS UNSATISFACTORY. THESE METHODS ARE USED 'EVERY' ARR PUSH PERIOD AND BTWN PUSHES WITH HEAVIES. WE NOW HAVE SEVERAL MORE 'YOUNG' CTLRS THAT ARE ON THE EDGE TRYING TO SURVIVE HOW ZME 'JAMS' US WITH ARRS; ESPECIALLY DURING PERIODS WHERE WX DICTATES NON VISUAL APCHS. OUR ARR RATE IS LOWER BUT ZME CAN'T SEEM TO REALIZE THIS. THIS PAST WK; I CALLED THE SUPVR AND OPERATIONAL MGR TO OBSERVE THE LACK OF SPACING; SPD; ETC; THAT THE SUPVR HAD REQUESTED TO ZME TMU. THE SECTORS JUST IGNORE AND HAVE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR OUR RWY AVAILABILITY AND WX REQUIREMENTS. THEY JUST WANT TO GET RID OF THEIR AIRPLANES. OF COURSE; THE SUPVR AND THE OM 'DID NOT' CALL THE ZME TMU OR ZME SUPVR ABOUT THE LACK OF TFC MGMNT. I GUESS THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO OR HAVE NO BRASS. THEY BOTH OBSERVED THESE PROBS AND DID NOTHING. THIS IS THE USUAL RESPONSE BY MGMNT. ZME 'RULES' THIS TRACON. WITH OUR INCREASING YOUNGER WORK FORCE HERE AND LACK OF MGMNT BRASS OPDEVS AND ERRORS WILL OCCUR. WE USE 1 ARR CTLR TO WORK A 2 ARR GATE FEED PLUS OVERFLTS; CLASS B AND SATELLITE TFC. DURING MODERATE TO HVY ARR PERIODS; THE TRACON RUNS ON THE EDGE OF LOSING CTL.

IN NO WAY DID I EVER INTEND TO PICK UP ANY KIND OF ICE BUT EVENTS HAPPEN AND I REALIZED THAT SHARING THIS INFO WOULD BE WORTH IT. THE FLT ENDED WITHOUT INCIDENT AND THEN I STARTED TO THINK OF SOME OF THE CAUSES THAT MADE THE SIT POSSIBLE. THE BIGGEST FACTOR WAS PRESSURE BY MANAGEMENT TO TAKE THE FLT IN AN AIRPLANE THAT IS NOT CAPABLE OF IMC AND SHEDDING ICE. THE ZZZ2 WX WAS RPTING 800 BROKEN AND 10 MILES VISIBILITY. ZZZ3 WX WAS 1200 BROKEN AND 10 MILES VISIBILITY. ZZZ1 DOES NOT HAVE RPTING WX. THE WX WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT THE SCHEDULED FLT BUT IT HAD BEEN TURNED DOWN BY ANOTHER PLT DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE WX. I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM ANOTHER SCHEDULED FLT BUT I WAS IN A BEECH 99 THAT WAS IFR CAPABLE. MANAGEMENT THEN APCHED ME ABOUT TAKING THE FLT AND USED PRESSURES FOR WHY I SHOULD ATTEMPT THE FLT; THESE WERE: 'PAX ARE WAITING AND WANT TO GET HOME;' 'YOU HAVE JUST COME IN FROM A FLT AND KNOW WHAT THE WX IS SO YOU CAN ALWAYS TURN AROUND;' 'WE'RE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE OTHER GUY WON'T TAKE THE FLT;' 'THE COMPANY CAN'T CONTINUE TO TELL THE PAX THAT WE ARE NOT FLYING BECAUSE OF WX WHILE OUR COMPETITION IS FLYING.' MY REPLY TO THESE WERE; 'THAT'S BECAUSE THEY FLY CESSNA 208 CARAVANS AND PIPER NAVAJO'S; BOTH WHICH ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF IMC AND SHEDDING ICE.' THESE PRESSURES COULD HAVE BEEN ANSWERED WITH A SIMPLE; 'NO GO.' EVERY TIME I FLY I LEARN SOMETHING NEW AND WITH THIS SIT IT HAS SHOWN ME THAT MANAGEMENT PRESSURES TO COMPLETE A FLT CAN PUT PLTS IN SITS THAT EXCEED THE ABILITY OF THE AIRPLANES AND THE PLTS WHO FLY THEM.",,,,"A C207 PLT IS PRESSURED INTO FLYING A CHARTER IN MARGINAL WX; AND ENCOUNTERS FREEZING RAIN.",

IN THE COURSE OF ASSUMING MY DUTIES; I LOOKED INTO EACH OF OUR 135 CHARTERED ACFT AND THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH 135 REGULATIONS. ONE ITEM THAT TURNED UP AS QUESTIONABLE CONCERNED OUR CESSNA 414. IN AUGUST OF 2002; CESSNA CAME OUT WITH A LARGE SUPPLEMENTAL INSPECTION DOCUMENT (SID) CONCERNING REPETITIVE NDT TESTING ON AIRFRAME PARTS AND VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE CESSNA 414'S. THIS IS A FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE; TIME CONSUMING INSPECTION. TO COMPLETE THE INSPECTION ALONE (NOT TO FIX ANYTHING FOUND DURING THE INSPECTION) WOULD BE IN EXCESS OF $80;000. THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME DISAGREEMENT WITHIN THE FAA AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THESE INSPECTIONS ARE REQUIRED FOR 135 OPERATORS. I HAVE CONTACTED THE FAA AFS-340 IN WASHINGTON; DC; AND THEY SAY THE SID'S ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE DONE BY 135 OPERATORS; UNLESS THE INDIVIDUAL OPERATOR'S OPS SPECS REQUIRE IT. I'VE CONTACTED VARIOUS OTHER OPERATORS THAT FLY CESSNA 414'S; SOME SAY THEIR FSDO'S REQUIRE THEM TO COMPLY WITH THE SID'S; OTHER OPERATORS SAY THEIR FSDO'S DO NOT REQUIRE THEM TO DO SO. OUR CESSNA 414 HAS NOT HAD ANY PART OF THESE SID INSPECTIONS COMPLIED WITH. THE POSSIBLE FINE IMPOSED BY THE FAA; SHOULD THEY DECIDE TO GO THROUGH WITH A 'VIOLATION' PROCEEDING; WOULD BE VERY SUBSTANTIAL. AFTER REVIEWING THE INSPECTION CRITERIA OF THE SID'S; THEY SEEM TO BE AIMED AT THE HIGH TIME ACFT; MOSTLY USED FOR FREIGHT OPS. OUR ACFT AND POSSIBLY MOST OF THE FLEET DON'T FIT INTO THIS USAGE AREA. WE HAVE SOME 5400 HOURS ON OUR ACFT; ALTHOUGH IT DOES FIT INTO THE 'BLANKET' OF MOST OF THE INSPECTIONS BEING DUE IF THE ACFT IS OVER 20 YEARS OLD; AS ARE MOST ACFT. I FEEL THAT WHEN THIS SID INSPECTION WAS ISSUED BY CESSNA; THEY AS A MANUFACTURER; SHOULD HAVE CONTACTED THE FAA AND COME UP WITH A REASONABLE TIME FRAME TO COMPLETE THESE INSPECTIONS OR DECIDE REALISTICALLY; WHICH ACFT SHOULD BE INSPECTED. NOW IT IS UP TO US OPERATORS TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS WITH OUR INDIVIDUAL FSDO; WHICH WE WILL BE MEETING WITH SHORTLY. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR IS CAUGHT IN A SIT THAT REQUIRES A DECISION FROM SOME AUTHORITY THAT CAN DECIDE IF THE SID IS ONLY A SERVICE BULLETIN OR A REQUIRED MANDATORY DOCUMENT THAT MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED. CONTACT WITH FAA AS-340 IN WASHINGTON; DC; SAY THE SID'S ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY 135 OPERATORS. BUT CHKING WITH OPERATORS OF C414 ACFT IN THE LOCAL REGION OF THE COUNTRY REVEALED SOME FLT STANDARDS DISTRICT OFFICES REQUIRE THE INSPECTION BE PERFORMED AND OTHER FLT STANDARD DISTRICT OFFICES DO NOT REQUIRE THEM TO MAKE THE INSPECTION.

PANEL 5725L IS A 6 INCH (APPROX) PANEL LOCATED UNDER THE L-HAND THRUST REVERSER HALF ON THE PYLON. THE THRUST REVERSER MUST BE OPENED TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE PANEL. THIS IS THE ONLY PANEL REQUIRING THRUST REVERSER OPENING TO REMOVE. ALL OTHER PYLON ACCESS PANELS REMOVED WERE PLACED IN A GROUP ON THE WING DOCKING STAND; WHICH WAS LOCATED IN FRONT OF THE WING; AS IT IS ONLY USED FOR AIRBUS A330 ACFT. ACCESS PANEL 5725L WAS PLACED ON OLDER SHELVES UNDER THE TAIL STAND AT THE REAR OF THE ACFT; POSSIBLY DUE TO BEING REMOVED SEPARATELY DUE TO THE REQUIREMENT OF OPENING THE THRUST REVERSER HALF TO REMOVE THE PANEL. THE PANELS ARE GROUPED ON THE INSTALLATION PAPERWORK WITH 3-6 PANELS ON SINGLE SIGNOFF BLOCKS. THE THRUST REVERSER OPEN/CLOSE PAPERWORK DOES NOT REFER TO THIS JOB CARD BEING COMPLETED BEFORE CLOSING THE THRUST REVERSER HALF.

WE WERE IMC THIS ENTIRE TIME. OUR TRACK CARRIED US APPROX 80-90 MI N OF OUR FILED PATH. USING THE RADAR; WE KEPT GREATER THAN 20 MI FROM THE TSTMS. CLRNC WAS TO FL370; BUT APCHING FL368; WE COULD NOT SUSTAIN A CLB OR ACCELERATE; SO FL350 WAS REQUESTED. AFTER REACHING FL350; WE WERE ABLE TO REMAIN LEVEL AT CRUISE OF MACH .83. AS WE APCHED THE N END OF THE WX; BEFORE WE TURNED EBOUND; WE FLEW INTO HVY RAIN WITH MODERATE TURB AT FL350. I COMMENTED THAT THIS WAS MORE THAN EXPECTED CONSIDERING THE ALT AND NO RETURN ON THE RADAR. THE RAIN AND TURB ONLY LASTED A COUPLE OF MINS. AFTER TURNING EBOUND AROUND THE N END OF THE LINE OF WX; IT WAS ONLY A SHORT TIME BEFORE WE WERE IN CLR AIR. I BELIEVE IT TO HAVE BEEN ABOUT 15 MINS AFTER FLYING IN CLR AIR THAT I HEARD A RUMBLING SOUND THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM THE AIR CONDITIONING SYS. I WAS TURNED AROUND IN MY SEAT DISCUSSING THIS SOUND WITH THE SO WHEN I NOTICED THE HIGH STAGE BLEED LIGHT WAS ON. MY COMMENT WAS; 'WHY IS THE HIGH BLEED ON? WE ARE NO LONGER USING WING ANTI-ICE?' AT THAT TIME; THE ACFT STARTED TO VIBRATE SLIGHTLY; THEN INCREASE. I TURNED TO LOOK AT MY INSTS AND NOTICED MY SPD DECREASING FROM ABOUT 280 KIAS. I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT AND STARTED TO LOWER THE NOSE TO REGAIN SPD. FO CONTACTED ATC TO INFORM THEM THAT WE COULD NOT MAINTAIN ALT AND WOULD BE IN A DSCNT. I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOTHROTTLES AND PUSHED THEM UP TO APPROX +100%. CONSIDERING THE ALT; I WAS NOT AGGRESSIVE ON ANY CTL INPUTS. MY PITCH ATTITUDE WAS SLIGHTLY BELOW THE HORIZON; BUT THE SPD CONTINUED TO DECREASE RAPIDLY TO 240 KIAS; BEFORE RAPIDLY RECOVERING. WE DSNDED TO FL250 AND MAINTAINED ABOUT 280 KIAS; TO DETERMINE WHAT HAD OCCURRED; AND HOW TO RESPOND. AT THIS ALT AND SPD; NO FLT CTL OR INST PROBS WERE EVIDENT. PITOT HEAT SYS WAS CHKED AND WORKING NORMALLY. EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE BACK TO NORMAL. NOT KNOWING IF THE AIRPLANE HAD SHED A PART THAT CAUSED THE NOISE AND VIBRATION; I DECIDED TO DECLARE AN EMER AND THAT DIVERTING TO THE NEAREST SUITABLE ARPT WAS THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION. THE ACFT WAS CONFIGURED EARLY TO DETERMINE THAT ALL CTLS WORKED APPROPRIATELY. AN UNEVENTFUL LNDG WAS MADE. IN RETROSPECT; THE EXTREMELY SLOW REDUCTION BY THE AUTOTHROTTLES WAS THE CAUSE OF THE BLEED SYS GOING INTO HIGH. THIS WENT UNNOTICED BY ALL. AT LAST GLANCE; THE ACFT WAS ON SPD AND ALT. NO UNSAFE GEAR LIGHTS ON WERE NOTICED. THE RECOVERY FROM THE SLOW SPD WAS STARTED BEFORE A FULL STALL COULD OCCUR. MY COMPANY IS NOW INVESTIGATION WHY THIS ACFT'S AUTOTHROTTLES SLOWLY RETARDED THE PWR TO IDLE WHILE MAINTAINING AN INDICATION OF STAYING ON SPD. THE AUTOPLT PERFORMED AS IT SHOULD BY PITCHING UP TO MAINTAIN THE ALT. QUESTION IS: WHY DID THE AIRPLANE INDICATE ON PROPER SPD; BUT IN REALITY; SLOW TO STALLING SPD? FROM A CREW MEMBER STANDPOINT; WE COULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THE NOISE THAT WE WERE INVESTIGATING AS BEING CAUSED BY THE ENG BLEED SYS SWITCHING TO HIGH BLEED; WHICH IN TURN IS CAUSED BY THE REDUCTION IN PWR. NOTICING THAT THE PWR HAD BEEN REDUCED WOULD HAVE BROUGHT UP THE RED FLAG THAT WOULD HAVE LED TO THE PREVENTION OF THIS INCIDENT.",,,,"A DC10-10 NEARLY STALLED WHEN THE CREW DID NOT DETECT A SLOW AUTOTHROTTLE REDUCTION.

WE MET THE CLB RESTRS AND THROUGH 12000 FT DEP ASKED US IF WE WERE GIVEN 7000 FT FROM CLRNC. SINCE I DIDN'T WRITE DOWN 7000 FT; I STILL THOUGHT THAT WE WERE EXPECTED TO GO TO FL190. I ANSWERED NO. DEP CTL SAID WE WERE NOT IN TROUBLE AND WE CONTINUED ON. WHEN SWITCHING TO ZDV; WE WERE ASKED TO CALL LAS TWR UPON ARR IN DEN. THE FLT CONTINUED UNEVENTFULLY.

THE ATC SUPVR WENT ON TO INFORM US THAT THE DEP CTLR HAD NOTED OUR CLBING TO FL190; CALL BUT DID NOT SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SEE WHAT YOU WOULD DO. IT APPEARS THAT THE TWR AND THE DEP CTL ARE HAVING SOME TROUBLE COORDINATING THE NEW RNAV PROCS AND WE WERE USED AS SOME SORT OF TEST CASE. THE CAPT ASKED IF MY ERROR WAS GOING ANY FURTHER THAN THIS CONVERSATION; AND THE CTLR SAID NO; THAT THE CONVERSATION WAS INFORMAL AND THEY JUST WANTED TO LET US KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. THERE WAS NO SEPARATION LOSS THROUGHOUT OUR CB. I CANNOT BELIEVE I MADE THAT MISTAKE; BUT I DID. I SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR A CLARIFICATION FROM CLRNC WHEN I INITIALLY THOUGHT THAT FL190 WAS NOT USUALLY WHAT WE ARE ASSIGNED OUT OF LAS VEGAS. I THINK I MAY HAVE BEEN DISTR WHILE COPYING THE CLRNC DUE TO AN MEL FUEL PROC THE CAPT WAS PERFORMING (OUTBOARD FUEL TANK FEED FAULT). I AM NEW TO THE AIRPLANE AND WANTED TO SEE WHAT HE WAS DOING TO COMPLY WITH THE MEL PROC. I BELIEVE I GOT DISTR. I WILL NOW VERIFY IF I HAVE ANY QUESTION AS TO WHAT ATC IS EXPECTING OF ME.

THIS ACFT DID NOT REFUEL. THE DOORS APPEARED CLOSED ON THE FUEL PAGE BUT WITH FUEL PUMPS ON; FUEL WAS MIGRATING BACK INTO OUTER R TANK FROM MAIN. IN 30 MINS; 500 LBS RETURNED TO R OUTER. I DON'T BELIEVE A COMPLETE SEAL OR CLOSURE WAS THERE SINCE ACFT DID NOT REFUEL. THEREFORE; IT IS POSSIBLE THE FUEL LEAK PROB WE HAVE HAD AND THE BURST FUEL DISKS HAD BEEN CAUSED BY THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE -- THE MAIN CONSTANTLY ADDING BACK PRESSURE WHERE PRESSURE SHOULD NOT BE. THERE WAS A PUSH TO TAKE ACFT. HAD VERBAL DISCUSSION WITH MAINT SUPVRS THAT FUEL QUANTITY WAS OK AND DRIP STICK INOP I SHOULD GO. I WONDER IF A BACK PRESSURE PROB WOULD HAVE ARISEN DUE TO INCOMPLETE CLOSURE OF THE R DOOR OUTER TANK. ANYHOW; I HAD DISCUSSED WITH MAINT CTL AND OUR PLAN WAS TO OPEN FUEL VALVE DOORS AND DRAIN OUT OUTER TANKS THEN REFUEL WITH ADDITIONAL 3500 LBS TO SEE IF TANKS WOULD FILL AND HOLD FUEL. THEY DID. THE SEQUENCE WAS NOW CORRECT. MANY TIMES WE TURN ON FUEL PUMPS BEFORE READING FUEL PAGE. IF ACFT NOT FUELED; TANKS MAY HAVE THIS PROB AND CREW DOES NOT KNOW IT. NO ECAM HERE. AFTER SEVERAL MINS OF FUEL PUMPS RUNNING; TANKS ARE WHERE THEY SHOULD BE AND DOORS MAY NOT BE CLOSED AND GETTING THIS BACK PRESSURE CONSTANTLY UNTIL NEXT REFUEL. I RECOMMEND ANY ACFT NOT REFUELED SHOULD; BY PROC; HAVE A FUELER OPEN AND CLOSE FUEL DOORS AS A PRECAUTION UNTIL A STUDY OF THIS ANOMALY HAS BEEN CHKED OUT. TOO MANY PEOPLE WANT TO RATIONALIZE WHY SOMETHING DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT AND THEN PUSH TO GO. IF SOMETHING DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT; IT ISN'T RIGHT UNTIL I HAVE ASSURED WHY IT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT. THE DRIP STICK WAS WORKING FINE AND INDICATING A PROB. A RUSH TO SLAP A DEFERRAL STICKER TO MOVE A FLT COULD HAVE HAD US DIVERTING WITH A FUEL LEAK.",,,,"AN A319 CAPT RPTS PRESSURE TO DISPATCH FLT WITH R OUTER FUEL TANK DRAINING INTO MAIN.

UPON RETURNING TO ZZZ AND DOING A PRE-LNDG CHK; IT WAS NOTED THAT THE NITROGEN THAT IS USED FOR BRAKING WAS LOW. IT WAS MY OPINION THAT IF I RAISED THE GEAR AGAIN TO GO TO AN ALTERNATE ARPT; THE BRAKE SYS WOULD BE FURTHER DISCHARGED. NOTE: EACH TIME THE GEAR IS CYCLED; THE BRAKES ARE AUTOMATICALLY APPLIED TO STOP THE ROTATION OF THE TIRES IN THE WHEEL WELLS. I DETERMINED THAT I HAVE OPERATED THE PLANE AT THIS LEVEL OF NITROGEN IN THE PAST AND THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE A PROB. DURING THE LNDG ROLL MY STUDENT STATED THAT HE HAD NO BRAKES. I THEN TOOK THE ACFT AND APPLIED THE BRAKES AND ATTEMPTED TO STEER THE ACFT WITH DIFFERENTIAL BRAKING. THERE WAS MINIMAL BRAKE PWR AND I REALIZED THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STOP IN THE RWY DISTANCE THAT WE HAD REMAINING. I TURNED THE ACFT TO THE R TOWARD A ROCK EMBANKMENT OR HILL. IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT I COMMENCED AN EMER SHUTDOWN OF THE ENG; SHUT OFF THE FIRE COCK VALVE AND APPLIED THE EMER BRAKES. THE ACFT; WHILE SLOWING FURTHER; STRUCK A VASI LNDG BOX ON THE N SIDE OF THE RWY CAUSING MINIMAL DAMAGE TO THE AIRPLANE EQUIVALENT TO HANGAR RASH. THE VASI LIGHT SYS WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED; HOWEVER. AFTER PASSING OVER THE VASI SYS; WE CROSSED THE N TXWY AND ROLLED OVER THE ROCK EMBANKMENT. THE ACFT CAME TO A STOP ON THE EDGE OF THE HILL. WE SECURED THE ACFT AND EXITED. AFTER RECOVERING THE ACFT FROM THE HILL WITH THE HELP FROM A LCL TOWING COMPANY; I DETERMINED THAT THE DAMAGE WAS LIGHT AND LIMITED TO THE LEADING EDGE OF THE WING WHERE IT CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE VASI BOX. BY APPEARANCES; IT LOOKED AS THOUGH I HAD STRUCK A BIRD. THERE WAS NO DAMAGE RESULTING FROM COMING TO REST ON THE EMBANKMENT AS THE ACFT CAME TO A STOP FROM APPLYING THE EMER BRAKES. THERE WAS NO FURTHER DAMAGE CAUSED DURING THE RECOVERY OF THE ACFT. LATER THAT EVENING; I CYCLED THE LNDG GEAR ON JACKS AND REFILLED THE NITROGEN BRAKE SYS. AFTER TAXIING THE ACFT TO VERIFY THAT WITH THE BRAKE SYS FULL; THE BRAKES OPERATED NORMALLY; I DEPARTED ZZZ TO FLY HOME WITHOUT INCIDENT. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THE ACFT INCURRED MINOR DAMAGE AND THE CAUSE OF THE LOSS OF BRAKING WAS JUST PLAIN RUNNING OUT OF NITROGEN. EACH TIME THE LNDG GEAR IS RETRACTED; THE NITROGEN PRESSURE STOPS THE ROTATING WHEELS AND SLIGHTLY DEPLETES THE LIMITED NITROGEN SUPPLY.

THE L AILERON WAS INSTALLED ON THE R WING; AND THE R AILERON WAS INSTALLED ON THE L WING USING INCORRECT HARDWARE. BEFORE FURTHER FLT; WE INSTALLED THE CORRECT HARDWARE AND PLACEMENT OF THE AILERONS IN THEIR CORRECT LOCATION. THE CAUSE OF THIS PROB WAS THE PAINT SHOP REMOVED AND INSTALLED THE FLT CTL SURFACES INSTEAD OF THE CONTRACTED REPAIR STATION HIRED BY THE PAINT SHOP. TO PREVENT RECURRENCE IS FOR THE PAINT SHOP TO HAVE TECHNICIANS FROM THE CERTIFIED REPAIR STATION USE THE CORRECT MAINT MANUALS TO REMOVE THESE CTL SURFACES AND REINSTALL THE CTL SURFACES AFTER BEING PAINTED AND BALANCE CHKED; AS THEY STATED IN THEIR LOGBOOK ENTRY. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THIS PAINT SHOP JUST WANTED TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS BY USING PAINT SHOP PEOPLE TO INSTALL THE AILERONS INSTEAD OF CALLING THE LOCAL CERTIFIED REPAIR SHOP THAT REMOVED THE AILERONS AND RUDDER. THE RPTR STATED THE AIRPLANE WAS FLOWN TO THEIR BASE SHOP WHERE THEY WERE TROUBLESHOOTING THE PLT'S RPT OF AIRPLANE ENTERING A SHALLOW L BANK WHEN THE CTLS WERE RELEASED. RPTEDLY AFTER SEVERAL INSPECTIONS AND TESTS OF THE AILERONS; IT WAS NOTED BY A TECHNICIAN THE LOCATION OF THE STATIC WICKS WERE WRONG. THE STATIC WICKS WERE ATTACHED TO THE TOP SURFACE OF BOTH AILERONS AND SHOULD BE MOUNTED ON THE LOWER SURFACE. RPTR STATED THIS MADE IT OBVIOUS THE AILERONS WERE INSTALLED WRONG; BOTH WERE UPSIDE DOWN IN THE WRONG PLACE. THE RPTR STATED THIS PAINT SHOP HAS BEEN KNOWN TO CUT CORNERS AND THE CERTIFIED SHOP THAT REMOVED THE AILERONS IS ALSO SUSPECT FOR PERFORMING POOR MAINT. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR ACN 660636 REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THE AIRPLANE WAS PREFLT CHKED TWICE; ONCE AFTER THE RUDDER WAS REMOVED FOR BALANCING AND WHEN THE RUDDER WAS INSTALLED AFTER BALANCING. THE AIRPLANE WAS FLOWN BACK TO HOME BASE. ONE RPT WAS WRITTEN UP ON THE PERFORMANCE; A SHALLOW LEFT BANK WAS EXPERIENCED WHEN THE CTLS WERE RELEASED. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 660636: THE FLT SCHOOL WAS HAVING ACFT X PAINTED IN ZZZ1. TWO PLTS TOOK TWO ACFT FROM ZZZ TO ZZZ1 TO BE PAINTED AND PICK UP ACFT X. OUR CHIEF OF MAINT WENT ALONG TO INSPECT ACFT X. DURING INSPECTION; IT WAS FOUND THAT THE RUDDER NEEDED TO BE REMOVED TO BE BALANCED; WHICH WAS NOT DONE DURING; BEFORE; OR AFTER BEING PAINTED. SO BEFORE THE FLT BACK FROM ZZZ1 TO ZZZ THE RUDDER NEEDED TO BE BALANCED BEFORE FLT. THIS WAS ON TUES/JUN/2005. THIS IS WHERE I GOT INVOLVED. ON WED/JUN/2005 AFTER THE RUDDER WAS BALANCED AND REINSTALLED ON THE ACFT; I PREFLIGHTED THE ACFT AND FLEW IT BACK FROM ZZZ1 TO ZZZ; 2:10 FLT. I LOOKED AT THIS ACFT 2 DAYS IN A ROW; PREFLIGHTED IT TWICE; OUR CHIEF OF MAINT WALKED AROUND IT AND ANOTHER IP FROM THE FLT SCHOOL ALSO WALKED AROUND IT AND NONE OF US REALIZED THAT THE AILERONS WERE INSTALLED INCORRECTLY. R AILERON WAS INSTALLED ON THE L WING UPSIDE DOWN. L AILERON WAS INSTALLED ON R WING UPSIDE DOWN. THIS WAS NOT DISCOVERED UNTIL THE ACFT WAS BACK AT ZZZ ON WED/JUN/2005 BY OUR MAINT PERSONNEL. THE ONLY PROB WITH THE FLT WAS THAT THE ACFT WANTED TO MAKE A SHALLOW L BANK WHEN THE CTLS WERE RELEASED. I WROTE UP THIS PROB IN THE ACFT TECHNICAL LOGBOOK ALONG WITH A PROB WITH THE FLAPS AND SEVERAL LIGHTS INOP. I DID NOT BELIEVE YOU COULD INSTALL THE AILERONS INCORRECTLY AND STILL BE ABLE TO CTL THE ACFT CORRECTLY INFLT.

THIS WAS IN THE VICINITY OF BRADE INTXN. ON THE INITIAL CALL TO APCH; I REQUESTED THE ILS RWY 23R. APCH CTL DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE OUR REQUEST AND ASSIGNED OUR FLT THE ILS RWY 23L. AT SOME POINT AFTER PASSING BRADE INTXN; APCH CTL ISSUED A CLRNC TO PROCEED DIRECT TO DOCAT INTXN. THE WORD 'IMMEDIATELY' WAS NOT USED. THIS INTXN IS LOCATED ON THE ILS RWY 23 LOCALIZER COURSE; 12.1 DME FROM THE RDU VOR. I ENTERED THE WAYPOINT NAME INTO THE FMS AND EXECUTED. AN FMC MESSAGE APPEARED IN THE SCRATCH PAD INDICATING THAT THE WAYPOINT WAS NOT CONTAINED IN THE DATABASE. I THEN BEGAN LOOKING AT THE APCH PLATE TO DETERMINE IF I COULD ENTER THE WAYPOINT USING LAT/LON; PLACE BEARING/PLACE BEARING; OR PLACE BEARING/DISTANCE INFO. AS I WAS DOING THIS; THE FLYING PLT BEGAN A TURN IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE WAYPOINT. I ENTERED THE WAYPOINT USING THE RDU 048 DEG RADIAL AT 12.1 DME AND EXECUTED. THE FLYING PLT THEN ENGAGED LNAV. AS THE ACFT WAS EXECUTING THE TURN; THE APCH CTLR (I ASSUME THE SUPVR) CALLED US VERY AGITATED THAT WE HAD NOT BEGUN THE TURN AS SOON AS HE ISSUED THE CLRNC. THE NEXT FEW XMISSIONS BETWEEN US WERE RATHER INTENSE. I WANTED TO EXPLAIN THE REASON; HOWEVER; THAT WAS NOT THE TIME TO ARGUE THE POINT. WE THEN ACKNOWLEDGED A HAND-OFF TO THE FINAL CTLR WHO ASSIGNED RWY 23R FOR LNDG. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1) ONCE DISCOVERING THAT DOCAT WAS NOT CONTAINED IN THE DATABASE; NOT REQUESTING A RADAR VECTOR UNTIL INFO WAS OBTAINED. THIS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AN OPTION. I DO NOT RECALL THE VOLUME OF RADIO XMISSIONS OCCURRING AT THE TIME. 2) DOCAT INTXN NOT CONTAINED IN THE FMC DATABASE; THEREBY REQUIRING CREW TO RESEARCH AND MANUALLY ENTER WAYPOINT COORDINATES TO ACCOMPLISH TASK. THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE FOR OUR MIXED FLEET OF B737-200/300 ACFT CONDUCTING FAR 121 SUPPLEMENTAL OPS. ONE COMMERCIALLY SUPPLIED NAVIGATIONAL DATABASE IS CONSTRUCTED THAT MAY BE LOADED INTO ALL ACFT. THE SIZE OF THE DATABASE IS BASED ON THE FMC WITH THE SMALLEST MEMORY (IE 256K). OUR DATABASE COVERS A LARGE GEOGRAPHIC AREA AND CONTAINS LOW AND HIGH ALT AIRWAYS AND WAYPOINTS. THE AIRLINE THEN SELECTS SPECIFIC ARPTS AND APCH PROCS; BASED ON OPERATIONAL NEEDS THAT WILL BE CONTAINED IN THE DATABASE. THE NUMBER OF ARPTS IS LIMITED TO THE REMAINING AVAILABLE BITES AFTER GEOGRAPHIC AREA AIRWAYS ARE LOADED. SOME WAYPOINTS ASSOCIATED WITH APCH PROCS MAY NOT BE CONTAINED IN THE DATABASE IF THE ASSOCIATED APCH IS NOT IN THE DATABASE. THIS WAS THE CASE WITH THE ILS RWY 23L APCH AND DOCAT. THE CREW HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING THIS UNTIL THEY ATTEMPT TO ENTER THE WAYPOINT INTO THE FMC. ALTERNATE WAYS OF ENTERING WAYPOINT INFO FOR WAYPOINTS NOT CONTAINED IN THE DATABASE ARE NORMALLY LAT/LON; PLACE BEARING/PLACE BEARING; OR PLACE BEARING/DISTANCE. THE LATER WAS USED IN THIS EVENT. 3) CTLR ASSUMING THAT CLRNC COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IMMEDIATELY. CTLRS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT ALTHOUGH ACFT MAY BE FILED INDICATING FMC OR GPS CAPABILITY (IE: /E; /F; /G); IT MAY TAKE THE CREW TIME TO ENTER A WAYPOINT IF IT IS NOT CONTAINED IN THE FMC DATABASE. SUMMARY: ALTHOUGH THE CTLR INDICATED THAT WE WERE NOT COMPLYING WITH THE ATC CLRNC; I TOTALLY DISAGREE AND DO NOT FEEL THAT ANY FAR WAS VIOLATED DURING THE ABOVE EVENT. I HAVE BEEN FLYING FOR OVER THIRTY YRS AND HAVE NEVER HAD A CTLR IMPLY NON COMPLIANCE DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME REQUIRED TO ENTER A WAYPOINT. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR ADVISED HE IS QUALIFIED ON MULTIPLE EQUIP TYPES OPERATED BY HIS EMPLOYER. SOME OF THE MORE RECENT EQUIP UTILIZES LATER FMCS IN WHICH GREATER MEMORY ALLOWS COMPLETE AIRWAYS DEFINITIONS. EARLIER ACFT; AS IN THIS CASE; HAVE MORE LIMITED DATA IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE. THE NEED TO MANUALLY ENTER WAYPOINTS NOT INCLUDED IN THE DATABASE IS DISTRACTING AND TIME CONSUMING. THE BRADE ARR STATES IN BOTH THE NARRATIVE AND GRAPHIC DISPLAYS THAT; 'THE USER SHOULD EXPECT 'RADAR VECTORS TO FINAL APCH COURSE.' HE WAS ANTICIPATING VECTORS AND HAD NOT ANTICIPATED THE NEED TO PROGRAM DOCAT.

A11 IS SHORT STAFFED AND MANAGEMENT REFUSES TO SCHEDULE OT TO ADEQUATELY COVER OUR SHIFTS. THIS MAY BE BECAUSE THE WESTERN PACIFIC SVC AREA HAS TOLD THEM TO DO THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS IS; ONLY THAT IT WILL GET WORSE AS THE DAYS GET LONGER AND WE GO INTO OUR SUMMER MONTHS WHERE TFC TYPICALLY DOUBLES; AND AT TIMES; TRIPLES THAT OF OUR WINTER TFC COUNTS. UPON ARRIVING FOR WORK THIS DATE AND TIME THERE WAS NO SUPVR ON DUTY. I WAS INFORMED BY THE CIC THAT ALL PERSONNEL EXCEPT ONE HAD BEEN SCHEDULED FOR THE 1400 SHIFTS AND WERE IN FACT DUE TO LEAVE AT THAT TIME; LEAVING ONE PERSON TO WORK A TWO SECTOR TFC SIT AND ALSO ACT AS THE WATCH SUPVR/CIC. AT THE TIME OF MY ARR NR AND SR WERE SPLIT; AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SINCE THE MIL WAS FLYING AND AN EMER WAS IN PROGRESS. I WAS INFORMED THAT UNLESS I CHOSE TO SIGN IN AT 2200L; THE ONE PERSON WOULD BE LEFT ALONE. NEEDLESS TO SAY I CHOSE TO SIGN IN AT 2200L. HAD I NOT SIGNED IN; THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY ONE CTLR WITH MODERATE TFC OF A SOMEWHAT COMPLEX NATURE AND AN IFE IN PROGRESS. THIS LEVEL OF TFC AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT IS NOT UNUSUAL AT A11; ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE TIME OF YR. AFTER BEING BRIEFED BY THE CIC AND ASSUMING HIS DUTIES (BRIEFING TOOK APPROX 3 MINS); I RE-OPENED SR AT THE REMAINING CTLR'S REQUEST; RELIEVING HIM OF THE SR FREQS. I ALSO DID QUITE A BIT OF COORDINATION FOR THE NR CTLR FROM SR. F15'S WERE FLYING AS WERE TWO C130'S; AN F15 WITH AN IFE; AND SEVERAL INBOUNDS TO ANC. IT WAS A TWO CTLR SIT ALL THE WAY. I COMBINED CIC WITH SR AT WHICH TIME THERE WAS NO GENERAL OVERSIGHT FOR THE OPERATION. I ADVISED THE TWO DEPARTING CTLRS THAT SINCE THE BRIEFINGS HAD OCCURRED AFTER THE END OF THEIR SHIFT; THEY WERE; PER CONTRACT; AUTHORIZED 2 HOURS OF OT. NEITHER ELECTED TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF SAME. I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT THE TWO WERE AFRAID OF MANAGEMENT REPRISALS AGAINST THEM IF THEY ELECTED TO TAKE THE OT. THIS FAC UNION REP EXACTLY DESCRIBED THIS SIT AS IN A MEETING THAT HE AND MYSELF HAD WITH THE FAC MANAGER AND ASSISTANT MANAGER. WE CAUTIONED THESE MANAGERS THAT THIS SIT WAS NOT UNUSUAL AND IN FACT; COULD/WOULD HAPPEN MANY TIMES THIS SUMMER. THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF A VERY LARGE ICEBERG. IT APPEARS THAT THE LACK OF SCHEDULED STAFFING WAS CREATED IN TWO PARTS. AN INITIAL SCHEDULING ERROR THAT HAD A CTLR ON A 1500 SHIFT ONE DAY AND THEN BACK TO A 6 AM SHIFT ON THE NEXT DAY. THE SCHEDULING SUPVR WHO SIGNED OFF ON THE TWO-WEEK SCHEDULE DID NOT CATCH THIS ERROR. THIS SIT WAS FURTHER EXACERBATED BY YET ANOTHER SUPVR CHANGING THAT CTLR'S SHIFT TO A 1400 ON AN ALREADY VERY SHORT EVENING RATHER THAN INSTRUCTING HIM TO WORK AS SCHEDULED; COME IN AT 7 AM ON THE NEXT DAY AND GIVING EXCUSED ABSENCE FOR THE HOUR BETWEEN 6 AM AND 7 AM. THE DAY SHIFT WAS MUCH BETTER STAFFED AND WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN ENHANCED BY HIM REPORTING AT 7 AM. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT WAS SEVERELY LACKING IN THIS INSTANCE AND COULD HAVE HAD SERIOUS RAMIFICATIONS. THERE WERE BETTER OPTIONS AVAILABLE THAN TO CRITICALLY SHORT THE EVENING WATCH. WITH ALL THAT WAS GOING ON UPON MY ARR; HAD THE FAC BEEN LEFT WITH ONLY ONE CTLR AT 2200 HRS; IT WOULD; IN MY OPINION; HAVE BEEN A VERY DANGEROUS SIT ALL FOR THE SAKE OF NOT PROPERLY SCHEDULING PERSONNEL AND OR UTILIZING MINIMAL OT. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT MANAGEMENT WILL CONTINUE TO SHORT STAFF AND DENY OT AT THIS FAC DURING THE BUSIEST TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN WE NEED IT THE MOST. THERE IS MUCH SUPPOSITION AND SPECULATION AS TO WHY THIS FAC IS IN THIS SIT. IT IS NOT FOR ME TO SUPPOSE OR SPECULATE WHY; ONLY TO REPORT THAT WHICH I FEEL UNSAFE. THE FAA IS NOW TRYING TO DOLLAR COST AVERAGE EVERY ASPECT OF ATC AND AS THAT TREND CONTINUES; THINGS CAN ONLY BECOME LESS SAFE TO THE POINT OF BEING DRAMATICALLY DANGEROUS.

I CHKED OUR COMPUTER SYS TO MAKE SURE THIS WAS NOT AN ORIGINATING FLT; AND DETERMINED THAT THIS WAS A CHARTER ARRIVING EARLY FROM ZZZ1. I AUTH THE CONTRACT MECH TO SVC THE ENG OIL AND CALL BACK FOR A WORK ORDER NUMBER. HE CALLED BACK SHORTLY THEREAFTER TO ASK WHAT TYPICALLY IS ADDED TO THE -700 ACFT ENG OIL DURING SVCING; AND HE HAD STATED THAT HE HAD ALREADY ADDED 3 QUARTS. HE INFORMED ME THAT ON THE PREVIOUS LEG; MAINT HAD CHANGED A COMPONENT ON THE #1 ENG FOR AN OIL LEAK. I ASKED THE CONTRACT MECH TO SVC THE ENG OIL TO FULL AND CALL BACK WITH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF QUARTS HE HAD ADDED. WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR HIM TO CALL BACK; I RESEARCHED WHAT HAD BEEN DONE TO THE #1 ENG. THE RESEARCH REVEALED THAT THE #1 ENG IDG GARLOCK SEAL HAD BEEN REPLACED. WHEN THE MECH CALLED BACK; HE RPTED THAT HE HAD ADDED 6 QUARTS OF ENG OIL TO #1 ENG. I THOUGHT IN MY OPINION THAT THIS AMOUNT WAS NOT ABNORMAL. I ALSO SUGGESTED THE RUNNING OF #1 ENG IF HE OR THE CREW FELT UNCOMFORTABLE DUE TO RECENT WORK TO THE ENG. I IMAGINED THAT ZZZ1 DID NOT TOP OFF THE ENG AFTER THE REPAIRS WERE MADE. THE LOGBOOK SHOWED THE SVCING OF #1 ENG. MAINT ADDED 3 QUARTS OF OIL; BUT THE OIL ENTRY SECTION OF THE LOGBOOK HAD BEEN LINED THROUGH. THERE WERE NO RPTED SIGNS OF AN OIL LEAK IN OR AROUND THE #1 ENG AS THESE PHONES CALLS WERE TRANSACTED. THE ACFT DEPARTED FOR A RETURN TRIP. 2 HRS AFTER THE ACFT HAD DEPARTED; I RECEIVED A CALL FROM A DISPATCHER STATING THAT ACFT WAS HAVING #1 ENG OIL QUANTITY PROBS. I ASKED THE DISPATCHER TO ACARS THE CREW FOR QUANTITY NUMBERS. THEY RPTED DEPARTING WITH 93% OIL QUANTITY. 1 HR OUT; THE PERCENT WAS 74%; AND AT 2 HRS OUT; THE QUANTITY WAS DOWN TO 57%. I CHKED THE COMPUTER FOR FLT INFO AND DETERMINED THAT THE FLT HAD AN ADDITIONAL 2+ HRS OF FLT TIME. I MADE THE DECISION; ALONG WITH THE DISPATCHER; TO DIVERT THE ACFT BECAUSE IN MY OPINION THE ACFT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT WITH 57% OIL QUANTITY REMAINING. THE ACFT WAS NEAR ZZZ2; WHERE WE HAD A MECH ON STAFF AND THE ACFT DIVERTED. I CALLED THE MECH TO INFORM HIM OF THE DIVERSION. I TOLD HIM THAT WE SVCED OIL IN ZZZ AND MECH IN ZZZ1 HAD WORKED THIS ENG 1 LEG PRIOR. AFTER THE ACFT HAD LANDED SAFELY; I RECEIVED A CALL FROM MECH IN ZZZ1 INQUIRING IF ACFT WAS RETURNING. I REPLIED THAT THE ACFT HAD DIVERTED FOR #1 ENG OIL QUANTITY PROB. I TOLD HIM THAT WHEN WE FIXED THE ACFT IT WOULD CONTINUE ON TO ZZZ1. NOT LONG AFTER THIS TOOK PLACE; MY TEAM LEAD INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD SPOKE TO A SUPVR IN ZZZ1 AND THAT THEY BELIEVED THAT AN O-RING WAS POSSIBLY MISSING FROM THE NEWLY INSTALLED GARLOCK SEAL ON #1 ENG. I SENT ALL NECESSARY PARTS TO ZZZ2 AND INFORMED THE MECH OF MY KNOWLEDGE THAT MAINT HAD LEFT AN O-RING OFF DURING ASSEMBLY OF THE GARLOCK SEAL ON #1 ENG IDG. WE CONFIRMED THIS AFTER REMOVAL OF THE IDG. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 660856: THE MECHS NOTIFIED THEIR SUPVR THAT THEY MAY HAVE LEFT AN O-RING OFF OF THE OUTER CASE OF THE GARLOCK SEAL. THE SUPVR CALL ME AT MAINT CONTROL AND ASKED ME TO WRITE A PLANNING ITEM TO INSPECT THE GARLOCK FOR A MISSING O-RING. A PLANNING ITEM MAY BE A FEW DAYS BEFORE IT IS ISSUED. MY PLAN WAS TO SEE OF THE ENG WAS USING OIL IN ZZZ AND HAVE THE SEAL REPAIRED. THE ACFT DID NOT ARR IN ZZZ UNTIL MY SHIFT WAS OVER AND I HAD PLANNED TO TURN OVER THE PROB TO THE NEXT CONTROLLER ON SHIFT. WHEN HE ARRIVED WE HAD SEVERAL EVENTS HAPPEN DURING THE TURNOVER TIME PERIOD AND I FAILED TO TELL THE NEXT CONTROLLER ABOUT THE POSSIBLE MISSING O-RING.

FOLLOWING ACR Y; ACR X LANDED RWY 6R IN AN UNMARKED WHITE WDB. MY ATTN TURNED TO RWY 2 WHICH HAD SEVERAL ACFT XING AND BACK-TAXIING DUE TO MULTIPLE TXWY CLOSURES. WHEN I RETURNED MY ATTN TO RWY 6R; I MOMENTARILY MISTOOK ACR X FOR ACR Y (ACR Y OFTEN FLIES WHITE; UNMARKED WDB'S) AND TOLD ACR Y TO TURN L AT TXWY D. I RECEIVED NO RESPONSE SINCE ACR Y WAS ALREADY ON GND CTL. ACR X TURNED L AT TXWY E AND HELD SHORT OF RWY 6L. OUR FACILITY HANDBOOK STATES THAT A WDB MAY NOT HOLD ON TXWY E WHILE ANOTHER ACFT LANDS ON RWY 6R. AT THIS POINT; ACR Z (A WDB) WAS ON ABOUT A 1 MI FINAL FOR RWY 6R. WHEN I RECEIVED NO RESPONSE TO THE INSTRUCTION TO USE TXWY D; I REALIZED THAT I WAS USING THE WRONG CALL SIGN. AT THIS POINT THE NATURAL PROGRESSION OF MY SCAN WAS TO LOOK AT MY STRIP BOARD TO OBTAIN THE CORRECT CALL SIGN. BEFORE I COULD DO THIS; HOWEVER; MY OPS MGR WHO WAS MONITORING IN THE TWR CAB (NOT PLUGGED INTO OR SIGNED ON ANY POS) WALKED UP NEXT TO ME AND IN A RAISED VOICE TOLD ME TO 'CROSS ACR Y; CROSS ACR Y' WHILE POINTING AT ACR X ON TXWY E. BELIEVING THAT MY OPS MGR HAD THE CORRECT INFO; I DID NOT HESITATE AND; USING THE MOST RECENT ACR Y CALL SIGN; TOLD ACR Y TO CROSS RWY 6L; TWICE. I RECEIVED NO RESPONSE SINCE ACR Y WAS ALREADY ON GND CTL. MY OPS MGR THEN TOLD ME TO 'SEND THAT GUY AROUND.' STILL BELIEVING THAT MY OPS MGR WAS CORRECT; I LOOKED AT MY STRIP BOARD WHICH HAD ACR Y IN A XING POS. I THOUGHT THAT IF ACR Y WAS THE ACFT HOLDING BTWN THE RWYS; AS I WAS BEING TOLD BY MY MGR; THEN THE NEXT STRIP (ACR X) MUST BE THE ACFT ON SHORT FINAL. I TOLD ACR X TO GO AROUND; TO WHICH THEY RESPONDED 'WE ARE ON THE GND.' AT THIS POINT I REALIZED THAT THE INFO THAT MY OPS MGR WAS GIVING ME WAS INCORRECT. I THEN TOLD ACR Z TO GO AROUND; TO WHICH THEY REPLIED 'WE ARE TOUCHING DOWN.' I TOLD ACR X TO CROSS RWY 6L AS ACR Z WAS TOUCHING DOWN ON RWY 6R. MY LCL ASSIST TOLD ME AFTERWARD THAT SHE WAS BEGINNING TO MOTION TOWARD THE STRIP BOARD TO POINT AT THE ACR X STRIP AND TELL ME TO CROSS ACR X WHEN THE OPS MGR TOLD US TO 'CROSS ACR Y.' AT THAT POINT SHE HESITATED; BELIEVING SHE WAS CONFUSED AS WELL. MY 'LA' AND I HAD BEEN WORKING BUSY TFC TOGETHER VERY WELL FOR APPROX 45 MINS WITH NO PROBS. I AM CONFIDENT THAT HAD I NOT RECEIVED AN INCORRECT INSTRUCTION FROM MY OPS MGR; THE NORMAL PROGRESSION OF MY SCAN WOULD HAVE RESOLVED THE ISSUE BEFORE IT OCCURRED. IF IT HAD NOT; THEN AT THE LEAST MY 'LA' WOULD HAVE FIXED THE PROB HAD SHE NOT BEEN CONFUSED BY THE OPS MGR'S INCORRECT INFO AS WELL. AS A CTLR; YOU TUNE OUT A LOT OF BACKGND NOISE IN THE TWR CAB; BUT WHEN YOU HEAR A RAISED VOICE -- ESPECIALLY THAT OF A SUPVR OR A MGR -- GIVING YOU A SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION; YOU DO NOT HESITATE -- YOU ACT ON IT. THE INFO THE OPS MGR GAVE US WAS INCORRECT AND I BELIEVE A DIRECT CAUSE OF THIS ERROR.

WHEN THE CTLR GAVE US THE VERT RESTR; THE CAPT PRESSED NAV ON THE FCP. THE NORMAL PROC IS TO ASK THE PNF (ME) TO DO THIS. SO THIS CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD. THE CAPT SAID SOMETHING ABOUT TURNING TO MAKE THE ALT RESTR AND ENGAGED THE AUTOPLT ALSO; TURNING THE VERT SPD WHEEL (NOTICED LATER; THE WRONG WAY). I WAS LOOKING AT MY DEP PLATE OR OUTSIDE AND DIDN'T NOTICE AT FIRST (DISTR); BUT THE ACFT WENT INTO APCH MODE AND THE AUTOTHROTTLES CAME BACK INSTEAD OF STAYING AT CLB PWR. AS I TRIED TO FIGURE THIS OUT; THE CAPT SAID HE WOULD LEAVE THE SLATS OUT AND HE GOT SLOW (APPROX 200-230 KTS). HE SAID TO MAKE THE CLB RESTR (10000 FT OVER LAX). MEANWHILE; I WOULD TURN OFF THE AUTOTHROTTLES AND PUSH UP THE PWR; AND HE WOULD DISCONNECT AND RECONNECT THE AUTOPLT SEVERAL TIMES. I TOLD HIM IF HE WOULD MAINTAIN A CLB AT 230 KTS; WE WOULD MAKE THE RESTR ACCORDING TO THE FMS VERT PROFILE. YET BECAUSE THE FLT DIRECTOR WAS IN A DSCNT; HE KEPT LOWERING THE NOSE. I KEPT TELLING HIM TO KEEP THE NOSE UP AND ALSO FIDDLED WITH THE THROTTLES AS THEY KEPT COMING BACK. THIS WAS BASICALLY A MESS AS WE TURNED INBOUND TO LAX. I MADE SURE HE KEPT THE AUTOPLT OFF AS WE GOT CLOSER TO LAX. I DON'T THINK WE MADE 10000 FT EXACTLY AT LAX; BUT IT WAS CLOSE. THE CTLR WAS MORE CONCERNED WITH THE SLOW SPD WITH ACFT BEHIND US. EVENTUALLY WE GOT BACK TO CLB MODE AND A FEW MINS LATER I REALIZED WE HAD SPUN THE VERT SPD WHEEL THE WRONG WAY. EITHER THIS; OR GOING TO NAV ON A MANUAL LEG IN FMS HAD CAUSED THE FMS TO GO INTO APCH MODE. IN HINDSIGHT; I SHOULD HAVE SLOWED DOWN THE TIME ON GND TO BRIEF (THE CAPT WAS MORE CONCERNED EARLIER WITH GETTING CATERING BEFORE LAUNCH THAN WITH THE WHEELS UP TIME). ALSO; I SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED HIS INCORRECT INPUTS TO THE FCP; AND BEEN MORE ASSERTIVE IN EITHER HANDLING THE FCP OR TAKING THE ACFT FROM HIM AS HE WAS CLRLY MIXED UP.

AT THIS SAME TIME WE NOTICED THAT WE WERE TURNING INSIDE OF AN AIRBUS AND RECEIVED A TA AND THEN AN RA FROM THE TCASII; WHICH WE RESPONDED TO AS WE TURNED BACK TO A 350 DEG HDG. AFTER WE WERE CLR OF THE CONFLICT WE WERE GIVEN A TURN TO 270 DEG HDG AND A CLB TO 9000 FT. THE REMAINDER OF THE FLT WAS UNEVENTFUL.

THE NARRATIVE SECTION OF THE SID DID NOT EFFECTIVELY COMPLIMENT THE GRAPHICAL PORTION ON THE CHART. WE THEN REVIEWED 2 OTHER DEP PROCS FROM SFO THAT FOLLOWED THE SAME ROUTING AND NOTICED THAT THEY BOTH SPECIFICALLY STATED IN THE NARRATIVE PORTION THAT THE TURN WAS TO BE MADE AT 4 DME OFF SFO.

THEY NOTIFIED ME THAT THEY WOULD BE PUTTING ME INTO A REDUCED REST OF 8 HOURS AND THAT I WOULD OPERATE BACK TO MY HUB AND OUT TO THE OVERNIGHT THE NEXT MORNING. THEY EXPLAINED THEY WERE LEGAL TO REDUCE ME TO 8 HOURS BECAUSE I WASN'T FLYING MUCH THE NEXT DAY AND NOT TO WORRY ABOUT THE REST OF MY TRIP. I WAS JUST TO GET UP IN THE MORNING AND DUTY IN AT XA:40 AM. THE NEXT DAY I DID DUTY IN AT XA:40 AM. IN RANGE TO THE HUB; I WAS INFORMED BY SCHEDULING THAT I WOULD BE OPERATING A SHORT ROUND TRIP ON MY BREAK BEFORE THE FLT TO MY OVERNIGHT. AFTER ARRIVING AT THE HUB; I CONTACTED CREW SCHEDULING AND ASKED THEM TO FAX ME A PARING SHOWING THE SCHEDULED FLT TIME FOR THE TRIP. I WAITED SEVERAL MINUTES AND THE FAX WAS NEVER SENT. I WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS A PLANE FULL OF PEOPLE WAITING FOR MY ARR SO THEY COULD GO TO THEIR DEST. I BOARDED THE ACFT; DID THE REQUIRED PAPERWORK; AND FLEW THE ROUND TRIP. I THEN PROCEEDED TO FLY TO THE OVERNIGHT STATION. WHEN I WAS THERE; I PICKED UP A PAIRING FROM MY TRIP AND REALIZED THAT; WITH THAT SHORT ROUND TRIP ADDED TO MY SCHEDULE; THEY WERE NO LONGER ABLE TO REDUCE MY REST TO 8 HOURS THE PREVIOUS NIGHT. NOT KNOWN TO ME; CREW SCHEDULING HAD CHANGED AND FALSIFIED MY DUTY-IN TIME THAT PREVIOUS MORNING TO 9 HOURS ON PAPER SO THE COMPUTER WOULD LEGALLY ASSIGN THE ADDED TRIP TO MY SCHEDULE. THIS WAS THE 14TH CHANGE TO MY SCHEDULE BY THE THIRD DAY OF MY TRIP. I FIND IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP WITH ALL THE REST REQUIREMENTS; LOOKING BACK AND LOOKING FORWARD; ESPECIALLY WHEN CREW SCHEDULING CHANGES MY SCHEDULE SO OFTEN. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THE COMPANY'S CREW SCHEDULING DEPARTMENT AS I UNDERSTAND THIS HAS BECOME A COMMON PRACTICE. I WILL HAVE TO; IN THE FUTURE; INSIST ON RECEIVING A SCHEDULED PAIRING BEFORE EVERY FLT AND VERIFY THAT ALL THE INFO IS CORRECT BEFORE I DEPART. OUR COMPANY PROCS ARE FOR THE COMPANY TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT POSSIBLE TO ENSURE CREW LEGALITY. THEY HAVE COMPUTER SYSTEMS IN PLACE THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO TRY TO CATCH ANY ASSIGNMENTS OF ILLEGAL TRIPS. BUT; WHEN CREW SCHEDULERS GO IN AND FALSIFY INFO; OVERRIDING THE COMPUTER BECAUSE OF A SHORTAGE OF PLTS; A SIT IS CREATED THAT NEEDS TO BE IMMEDIATELY ADDRESSED. IN THE CURRENT SIT OF THE AIR CARRIER INDUSTRY; WITH EVERY AIRLINE LOSING SO MUCH MONEY AND TRYING TO CUT COSTS; I HAVE SEEN A DISTURBING TREND OF TRYING TO PUSH FLT CREWS TO; AND ON OCCASION; PAST THEIR LEGAL LIMITS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATED THAT THIS INCIDENT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT CREW SCHEDULING HAD ALTERED HIS 'DUTY-IN' TIME AND THAT IT IS A COMMON PRACTICE; ESPECIALLY WITH PLTS ON RESERVE.

WE WERE DOING PREFLT CHKS AS THE PAX WERE BOARDING AND MAINT WAS STILL ONBOARD BUT HAD ALREADY SIGNED THE AML FOR RETURN TO SERVICE. HOWEVER; THE EMER LIGHTS WOULD NOT TEST (THEY WOULD NOT EVEN COME ON; WELL MAYBE THEY DID; BUT BY THE TIME I UNBUCKLED AND ROSE UP TO LOOK OVER THE FLT ATTENDANT; MECH; AND THE BOARDING PAX; THEY WERE OUT); AND WE PLACED AN ENTRY IN THE AML REFLECTING THE DISCREPANCY. OUR MAINT TECH MADE SOME CALLS AND AFTER 15 MINS RAN A FUNCTIONAL CHK ON THE SYSTEM. THE LIGHTS CAME ON FOR 15 SECONDS AND THEN DIED. HE STATED THAT THE BATTERIES HAD BEEN REPLACED OVERNIGHT AND SINCE THEY HAD BEEN IN A FREEZER; THEY NEEDED TO 'THAW' OUT. HE ALSO STATED THAT THEY HAD BEEN INSTALLED 6 HOURS PREVIOUS. (HMMMM... A RUMP ROAST WILL THAW OUT IN TWO HOURS.) AND IF THEY NEEDED THAWING OUT; WHY WAS THE ACFT SIGNED OFF? WE WAITED ALMOST 30 MINS AND ANOTHER TEST WAS DONE. THEIR TEST REQUIRES THAT THE LIGHTS REMAIN ON FOR 60 SECONDS. HOWEVER; THE LIGHTS DIED IN 45 SECONDS. WE WAITED ALMOST ONE MORE HOUR AND HE DID ANOTHER TEST; THIS TIME THE LIGHTS DID LAST 60 SECONDS; BUT WERE STARTING TO DIM FAST. HE QUICKLY TURNED THE LIGHTS OFF AND DECLARED THE SYSTEM READY FOR SERVICE AND MADE AN AIRWORTHY SIGN OFF IN THE AML (I HAVE A PHOTO COPY). TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT; WE RECEIVED HEAVY PRESSURE FROM MAINT CTL TO TAKE THE ACFT. LATER OUR BASE MGR WAS CALLED TO ATTEMPT TO PRESSURE US INTO TAKING THIS ACFT WITH THE EMER LIGHTING SYSTEM IN AN UNAIRWORTHY STATE. HAVING WITNESSED THE WHOLE EVENT; WE KNEW THE BATTERIES WERE DEAD WHEN THE ACFT ARRIVED AT THE GATE. WE KNEW THAT THEY WERE CHARGED JUST ENOUGH TO PASS THE 60 SECOND TEST AND THAT THEY COULD NOT BE DEPENDED UPON TO LAST EVEN ONE MINUTE MORE. THE LOCAL MECHANIC TOLD US THAT THERE WERE MAYBE TWO MORE BATTERIES IN THE ENTIRE MAINT SYSTEM (EACH ACFT NEEDS FOUR) AND THAT THEY HAD BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT IT FOR WEEKS. OUR QUESTION TO MAINT CTL WAS; 'HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CHARGE THE EMER LIGHTS?' IN THE ACFT FROM A COLD DEAD STATE? THE REPLY WAS THAT NO ONE KNEW. I; FOR ONE; FIND THAT IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE. WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SIMPLE BATTERY SWAP AT THE GATE TURNED INTO A LENGTHY DELAY AND CANCELLED FLTS DEPRIVING OUR PAX OF THE SVC THEY DESERVE AND PAID FOR. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR INDICATED THAT DURING THE FOUR HOURS THE AIRPLANE WAS DELAYED FOR CHARGING AND TESTING; THE CAPT WAS SUBJECTED TO HEAVY PRESSURE FROM MAINT CTL TO TAKE THIS INOP EMER LIGHTING SYSTEM. REPORTEDLY; NO ONE HAD ANY ANSWERS ON HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES AND NO BATTERY CHANGE AVAILABLE; NOR HOW LONG TO CHARGE THE EXISTING BATTERIES. THE RPTR INDICATED THAT THIS COMPANY NEEDS A COMPLETE SHAKE UP TOP TO BOTTOM. HE STATED HE TOOK THE AIRPLANE ONLY AFTER THE LIGHTS PASSED THE 60 SECOND TEST; ADDING THE PRESSURE TO FLY AN UNAIRWORTHY AIRPLANE WAS GREAT FROM MAINT CTL; MAINT MGR; CHECK AIRMEN; AND OTHER UPPER CONCERNED MANAGERS.",,,,"A CRJ-200 CAPT RPTS AN AIRPLANE JUST OUT OF MAINT HAD EMER LIGHTING FAIL TESTS.

UPON CLRNC FOR TKOF; TURNED ON LNDG LIGHTS AND LINED UP FOR RWY 3 DEP. AFTER AIRBORNE; RETRACTED GEAR AND PROCEEDED WITH AFTER TKOF CHK. WITHIN A FEW SECONDS; ALL ELECTRICAL (LIGHTS; ETC) DIMMED CONSIDERABLY. AMMETER INDICATED A DISCHARGE. RECHKED GENERATOR SWITCHES WERE ON AND BATTERY SWITCH ON. CYCLED ALTERNATOR CIRCUIT BREAKERS IN TROUBLESHOOTING (BREAKERS HAD NOT POPPED OUT BUT DECIDED TO PULL THEM AND RESET). THE L ALTERNATOR BREAKER HAD NO EFFECT ON DIMINISHED ELECTRICAL PWR; HOWEVER; WHEN THE R CIRCUIT BREAKER WAS PULLED AND RESET; THE CABIN AND PANEL LIGHTS LIT UP IN FULL NORMAL BRIGHTNESS (PANEL LIGHT KNOBS WERE NEVER CHANGED AFTER SETTING THEM TO FULL BRIGHT AFTER STARTUP ON THE GND). CONCERNED WITH CONTINUING A NIGHT FLT TO ZZZ1 WITH POTENTIAL ELECTRICAL PROBS; I REQUESTED TO ZZZ TWR FOR A RETURN TO LNDG INDICATING TO THEM I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH MY ELECTRICAL SYS. WAS STILL ON THE UPWIND FROM MY DEP DURING ALL OF THIS. TOWARDS THE END OF XWIND LEG INTO THE TURN TO DOWNWIND; ALL ELECTRICAL SYS DIMMED AGAIN. AGAIN; I RECYCLED CIRCUIT BREAKERS SEVERAL TIMES WITH NO LUCK IN BRINGING LIGHTS BACK UP TO FULL BRIGHTNESS THIS TIME. WAS CLRED TO LAND BY THE TWR. IT WAS CLR THAT THE LIGHTS WERE CONTINUING RAPIDLY TO DECREASE IN BRIGHTNESS. I LOWERED THE GEAR ASSUMING THAT I MIGHT NOT HAVE AVAILABLE ELECTRICAL PWR TO COMPLETE THE TASK FURTHER DOWN THE DOWNWIND LEG. LIGHTS WERE STILL DIMMING; AND I LOWERED FLAPS IN THE PATTERN AS NORMAL. EACH ITEM; GEAR; AND FLAPS; CAUSED FURTHER DECREASE IN CABIN LIGHTING. ON FINAL; THE CABIN LIGHTS WERE EXTREMELY DIM. AS I BEGAN FLARE AND REDUCED PWR I HEARD A BARELY AUDIBLE GEAR WARNING HORN AND ELECTED TO GO AROUND. AT THIS POINT I HAD TOTAL FAILURE OF ELECTRICAL SYS WITH NO CABIN LIGHTS; RADIOS; NAV EQUIP; OR NAV AND LNDG LIGHTS. THE FLT INSTS WERE DIFFICULT TO SEE IN TOTAL DARKNESS UNTIL I COULD GET MY FLASHLIGHT SITUATED. TRIMMED FOR CLB BUT WAS UNABLE TO RETRACT FLAPS (AT 40 DEGS AS FAR AS I COULD TELL). AFTER CLB; ESTABLISHED (VERY POOR CLB WITH FULL FLAPS AND GEAR HANGING OUT) I TRIED TO CONTACT TWR WITH NO SUCCESS. HAD A HANDHELD RADIO WHICH I KEEP IN WAITING AND CONTACTED TWR WITH THAT. DESCRIBED MY PROB AND WAS CLRED TO CIRCLE JUST N OF THE FIELD TO TRY AND LOWER THE GEAR. I CRANKED THE GEAR HANDLE UNTIL I COULD NOT APPLY WHAT FELT LIKE ANY MORE PRESSURE. WAS FLYING HOLDING A FLASHLIGHT THE DURATION OF THE FLT TO ILLUMINATE PANEL AND WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AIRSPD WITH ALL OF THE DRAG FACTORS; AND CONCERNED WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING AN ENG WITH MY PRESENT CONFIGN. AFTER CRANKING GEAR HANDLE AS MUCH AS I COULD; I COMPLETED A FLY-BY OF THE TWR FOR A VISUAL OF THE GEAR. I TRIED TO PICK UP AS MUCH AIRSPD AS I COULD WITHOUT LOSING TOO MUCH ALT SO AIRFLOW MIGHT PUSH THE NOSE GEAR BACK IF IT WAS NOT LOCKED TO AID IN THE TWR'S VISUAL CHK. TWR RPTED '3 GEAR DOWN AND LOCKED.' I HAD NO WAY TO DETERMINE IF THE GEAR WAS LOCKED AS I HAD NO INDICATORS WITH THE TOTAL ELECTRICAL FAILURE. I REQUESTED ON MY HANDHELD RADIO THAT THE EMER EQUIP BE CALLED OUT TO ASSIST. I TRIED AGAIN TO RESET CIRCUIT BREAKERS; BATTERY AND GENERATOR SWITCHES WITH NO LUCK. LINED UP FOR LNDG AND TRIMMED FOR THE APCH. UPON RETARDING THROTTLES; I MOVED MY HANDS TO THE MIXTURES. AS THE FIRST INDICATION OF COLLAPSING GEAR WAS NOTICED; I RETARDED THE MIXTURES; HOWEVER; I WAS UNABLE TO SECURE COMPLETELY BEFORE THE PROPS DID STRIKE THE GND. AS I SLID DOWN THE RWY THE ACFT BEGAN TO VEER TO THE L SO I APPLIED R RUDDER TO CORRECT AND WAS SURPRISED TO NOTICE THAT THE RUDDER WAS STILL EFFECTIVE EVEN DURING THE BELLY SLIDE DOWN THE RWY. WHEN STOPPED I TURNED THE MAGNETOS AND ELECTRICAL GANG-BARS OFF AND IMMEDIATELY EVACED THE ACFT IN CASE OF FIRE (THERE WAS SMOKE IN THE COCKPIT AFTER THE SLIDE CAME TO A HALT BUT NO POST-FIRE DEVELOPED). I WAITED OUTSIDE THE ACFT FOR FIRE EQUIP WHICH ARRIVED IN SECONDS AFTER I EXITED THE PLANE. THE ASPECTS THAT I CONSIDER MOST IMPORTANT TO WHAT THE FAA IS CLASSIFYING AS AN INCIDENT DUE TO NO MAJOR STRUCTURAL DAMAGE ARE: 1) I ALWAYS HAVE A HANDHELD GPS AND COM RADIO SET UP FOR MY DEPS WITH FREQS ALREADY SET. 2) ALL TRAINING THAT I HAD IN EMER GEAR EXTENSION WAS WITH THE LNDG LIGHT INDICATOR ON TO SHOW DOWN AND LOCKED. TRAINING MUST INCLUDE PRACTICE IN WHAT DOWN AND LOCKED 'FEELS' LIKE IN CASE THE GREEN GEAR DOWN LIGHTS DO NOT WORK. 3) IF SYS (FLAPS; ETC) ARE ELECTRICAL DURING ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTIONS; DO NOT PLACE THEM IN FULL POS; IF POSSIBLE; IF THAT POS MIGHT HINDER PERFORMANCE OF A POTENTIAL MISSED APCH. 4) FOR CTLRS TO ISSUE A 'GEAR DOWN AND LOCKED' REPLY MIGHT GIVE PLTS AN UNDUE REASSURANCE THAT THE GEAR IS OK. WOULD BE MORE ADVISABLE TO STATE 'GEAR APPEARS DOWN' AND MAYBE TO INDICATE THAT THEY CAN'T DETERMINE 'LOCKED' FROM THE GND. 5) AS STUDENTS; PLTS SHOULD BE TRAINED ON NIGHT FLYING WITH NO ELECTRICAL SUPPLY AND HOLDING A FLASHLIGHT WHILE FLYING AND PERFORMING OTHER DUTIES. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THE LNDG GEAR IS OPERATED BY THE ELECTRIC MOTORS AND WITH PWR LOST THE LNDG GEAR HAD TO BE HAND CRANKED DOWN. THE GEAR WAS CRANKED UNTIL THE GEAR CRANK COULD NOT BE MOVED ANY FURTHER AND WITH NO INDICATIONS OF GEAR POS; THE GEAR WAS BELIEVED TO BE DOWN AND LOCKED AS CONFIRMED BY THE TWR FLY-BY.

THERE WERE NO VIOLATIONS OF FARS OR COMPANY PROCS. FLT DEPARTED OVER AN HOUR LATE DUE TO EARLIER TSTMS IN THE ZZZ AREA. WE DEPARTED WITH 19000 LBS OF FUEL WITH ZZZ1 AS AN ALTERNATE. ENRTE WE RECEIVED AN ATC RE-RTE TO THE S DUE TO A LINE OF WX ALONG OUR RTE AND THE ARR. THAT IS WHEN I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE #A FLT ATTENDANT WHO WAS CALM BUT CONCERNED 'THAT A PIECE OF THE WING WAS FALLING OFF.' I ASKED HIM TO BE MORE SPECIFIC AS HE DESCRIBED IT AS 'THE ORANGE THING THAT TELLS YOU IT'S A 700 LOOKS LIKE IT'S FALLING OFF THE WING.' WE CONTINUED IN HOLDING AND I ASKED THE FO TO GO TO THE CABIN TO VISUALLY INSPECT THAT AREA THAT THE FLT ATTENDANT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT. THE FO RETURNED TO THE COCKPIT AND RPTED TO ME THAT YES INDEED THE CANOE ASSEMBLY WAS EXTENDED WELL BELOW THE WING AND POSSIBLY DAMAGED. I DECIDED AT THAT TIME I WANTED A VISUAL INSPECTION OF MY OWN TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF ANY DAMAGE AND WHAT CONCERNS I MIGHT HAVE REGARDING CONFIGURING THE ACFT FOR LNDG. IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE ENTIRE CANOE ASSEMBLY AND THE TRACK IT FOLLOWS WAS FULLY EXTENDED AS IT WOULD BE AT FULL FLAP EXTENSION; YET THE TRAILING EDGE FLAPS WERE UP. IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DETERMINE IF ANY DAMAGE HAD OCCURRED. I ALSO FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT WE COULD HAVE FLOWN OVER 2 HOURS AT .79 WITH THE ENTIRE CANOE ASSEMBLY EXTENDED SO FAR BELOW THE WING WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF VIBRATION; ROLL; OR YAW. THE FLT ATTENDANT FELT CONFIDENT THAT HE HAD VIEWED THE WING SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE FLT AND THAT THE WING WAS NOT IN THAT CONDITION. DURING THE TIME I WAS IN POSSESSION OF ACFT X; I HAD NOT ENCOUNTERED ANY TURB OR EXCEEDED ANY AIRSPD LIMITS. THE ACFT WAS IN HOLDING AT 22000 FT AND 210 KTS IN A CLEAN CONFIGURATION AT THE TIME IT WAS RPTED TO ME. THE FO AND I DISCUSSED IN DETAIL ANY CONCERNS WE MIGHT HAVE REGARDING THE FLAP EXTENSION. I THEN CONTACTED MAINT CTL AND DISPATCH FOR ANY OF THEIR COMMENTS OR CONCERNS REGARDING THE FLAP EXTENSION. ATC WAS ADVISED OF OUR INTENTION TO LAND AT ZZZ1. WE REQUESTED A LONG; SLOW FINAL WHICH OF COURSE PROMPTS THEM TO QUERY AS TO A POSSIBLE PROB. I ADVISED THEM THAT I HAD NO PROB AT THE TIME; BUT THAT I WAS AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ENCOUNTERING A PROB DURING FLAP EXTENSION. DUE TO EVEN A REMOTE POSSIBILITY THAT WE COULD DROP THE ENTIRE CANOE ASSEMBLY ON LNDG OR DRAG ANY PARTS THAT COULD CAUSE SPARKS UNDER THE WING; I REQUESTED THE TRUCKS TO BE AVAIL AT THE RWY. WE EXTENDED THE FLAPS ONE NOTCH AT A TIME AND WERE PREPARED TO ACT ON ANY ABNORMAL INDICATION. THE FLAP EXTENSION WAS NORMAL AND A NORMAL LNDG WAS MADE. AT THE TIME WE BECAME AWARE OF A POSSIBLE PROB; WE HAD THE LUXURY OF OVER 7000 LBS OF FUEL; CLR WX IN ZZZ1; AND OVER 11000 FT OF RWY AVAILABLE. THE FO AND I WERE ABLE TO DISCUSS AND PLAN FOR ANY FLAP EXTENSION PROB WE MIGHT INCUR. WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE SEVERAL PA'S; HAVE CLEAR COMMUNICATION WITH DISPATCH AND MAINT CTL; AND MOST IMPORTANT; WE HAD EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION WITH OUR FLT ATTENDANTS TO ADDRESS ANY OF THEIR CONCERNS.

SBN APCH GAVE VECTORS TO AVOID TFC CONFLICTS AND THEN RELEASED ME TO CONTINUE OWN NAV. AS I APCHED ELX VOR; I ENCOUNTERED RAPIDLY DETERIORATING WX: LOWERING CEILING AND LOWERING VISIBILITY IN LIGHT RAIN AND MODERATE TURB. AS THE CEILING LOWERED TO UNCOMFORTABLE LEVEL; I CONTACTED ZAU; ADVISED OF MY LOCATION AND THAT VFR WAS RAPIDLY DETERIORATING AND ASKED FOR IFR CLRNC INTO 35D.

WHILE SETTING UP FOR THE APCH; I WAS GIVEN A VECTOR AND I TURNED TO THE HDG.

FOCUSING ON THE INSTS; I RECOVERED TO LEVEL FLT AND CLBED BACK TO 3000 FT. BY THAT TIME; I HAD LOST MY SITUATIONAL AWARENESS: I COULD NOT SEEM TO ORIENT MY LOCATION IN RELATION TO THE APCH. I BELIEVE I INFORMED APCH OF MY EXPERIENCING VERTIGO; BUT AT THIS POINT; I AM NOT POSITIVE THAT I CLRLY EXPLAINED MY PREDICAMENT TO APCH CTL. APCH ISSUED ME VECTORS TO THE IAF AND I MADE THE APCH INTO 35D. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: ALTHOUGH I AM INST RATED AND IFR CURRENT; I AM A PLT FROM THE DESERT SW WITH LITTLE ACTUAL IMC EXPERIENCE. MOST OF MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN 'HOOD TIME.' I BELIEVE THIS LACK OF IMC TRAINING/EXPERIENCE WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO MY EXPERIENCING VERTIGO. AS A PLT UNFAMILIAR WITH THE AREA; I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW RAPIDLY THE WX CAN CHANGE IN MICHIGAN. THIS WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO FINDING MYSELF IN IMC ON A VFR FLT PLAN. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO MY LOSS OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS INCLUDED THE FACT THAT DURING MY VERTIGO EVENT; I HAD MADE DSNDING TURNS AFTER HAVING BEEN GIVEN VECTORS FOR THE APCH. MY UNFAMILIARITY OF THE TERRITORY ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE LOSS OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. CORRECTIVE ACTION: WHEN THE CEILINGS LOWERED TO UNSAFE LEVELS; I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED CTR FOR AN IFR CLRNC. WHEN I DISCOVERED THE INSTS WERE NOT AGREEING WITH MY SENSE OF BAL; I RELIED ON THE INSTS. WHEN I DISCOVERED I WAS IN A DSNDING BANK; I RECOVERED BY FOCUSING ON THE INSTS AND USING UNUSUAL ATTITUDE RECOVERY TRAINING TO RETURN TO STRAIGHT AND LEVEL FLT (THROTTLE BACK; LEVEL WINGS AND BRING THE NOSE UP). HUMAN PERFORMANCE: THE WEAKEST PORTION OF MY PERFORMANCE WAS NOT ARTICULATING TO APCH THAT I HAD EXPERIENCED VERTIGO AND SUBSEQUENT LOSS OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. I FURTHER DID NOT ARTICULATE THE IMMEDIATE NEED FOR VECTORS BECAUSE OF THIS. THE CTLR DID RECOGNIZE THAT I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY GETTING TO THE IAF AND OFFERED VECTORS; WHICH WERE GRATEFULLY ACCEPTED. POINTS LEARNED: 1) IF MARGINAL VFR IS FORECAST; ALWAYS FILE IFR IN UNFAMILIAR TERRITORY. 2) PRACTICE IFR IN ACTUAL IMC RATHER THAN JUST HOOD TIME. THIS IS DIFFICULT IN THE SW; BUT CRITICAL TO SAFE IFR IN IMC. 3) LOSS OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS REQUIRES PROMPT NOTIFICATION TO ATC AND A REQUEST FOR VECTORS. 4) EMPHASIS ON UNUSUAL ATTITUDE RECOVERY IN IFR AND VERTIGO RECOGNITION/RECOVERY ARE A CRITICAL PART OF IFR AND VFR RECURRENT TRAINING.",,,,"PLT OF PA28 ENCOUNTERS WORSE THAN FORECAST WX AND FINDS HIMSELF IN IMC CONDITIONS AND SUFFERING VERTIGO.

I WAS MOTIONED BY A COUPLE IN XY TO LOOK AT THE MAN IN Z. WHEN I GOT THERE; THE COUPLE SAID SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE MAN NEXT TO THEM. HE WAS VIOLENTLY TRYING TO GET OUT OF HIS SEAT; BUT HE HAD HIS SEATBELT STILL ON HIM. I ASKED HIM IF HE WAS OK; AND HE DID NOT RESPOND OR LOOK AT ME; AS IF I WERE NOT THERE. CONCERNED THAT HE WAS HURTING HIMSELF AND PROBABLY ONLY HAD TO USE THE LAVATORY; I UNSNAPPED HIS SEATBELT AND HE GOT UP AND PROCEEDED AFT. SOMETHING TOLD ME TO FOLLOW HIM. THE #1; #2 AND #4 FLT ATTENDANTS WERE IN THE GALLEY. I MOTIONED TO THEM AS HE AND I WERE NEAR THE GALLEY/BATHROOM AREA THAT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HIM. HE PASSED THE BATHROOMS AND PROCEEDED INTO THE AFT GALLEY; WHERE HE JUST STOOD THERE. I TOLD THE #2 FLT ATTENDANT; WHO WAS THE SPEAKER; THAT MAYBE HE DOES NOT SPEAK ENGLISH AND TO TELL HIM WHERE THE BATHROOM IS. SHE SAID SOMETHING IN SPANISH. AGAIN HE DID NOT RESPOND; JUST LOOKING. JUST AS SHE AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN AWE; HE REACHED OUT AND WENT TO THE 3L DOOR. I SHOUTED TO THE #2 FLT ATTENDANTS 'HE'S GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR!' SHE TRIED TO STEP SOMEWHAT BTWN HIM AND THE DOOR AND HELD OUT HER HAND TO STOP HIM. SUDDENLY HE YELLED AND SMACKED HER IN THE FACE. HE THEN STARTED TO GRAB; PUSHING AND PULLING HER IN AND AT THE FACE VERY VIOLENTLY. HE WAS GRUNTING LOUDLY. AFTER A SECOND OR TWO OF BEING IN SHOCK; I WENT TO TRY TO PULL THE MAN OFF OF THE #2 FLT ATTENDANT. HE WAS EXTREMELY STRONG. HE WAS ABOUT 5 FT 6 INCHES TO 5 FT 7 INCHES; 160-170 LBS; AND MID-TO-LATE 60'S. I BEGAN TO PULL HIM. HE THEN TURNED AND WENT AFTER ME; PUSHING ME INTO DOOR 3R AREA. I BELIEVE HE STILL HAD A HAND ON HER. WE CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE WITH THE MAN. I YELLED TO GET HIM DOWN; AND AS WE STARTED WRESTLING TO GND; HE GRABBED MY R LEG; BTWN MY ANKLE AND SHIN; AND WAS TRYING TO BRING IT TO HIS MOUTH. I WAS ABLE TO FREE MY LEG AND WE CONTINUED TO FIGHT WITH HIM TO KEEP HIM NEAR/ON THE FLOOR. ONE OF US SHOUTED FOR THE CUFFS. AS THE #4 FLT ATTENDANT WENT FOR HER CUFFS AND MAN (HELPER) CAME AND WAS WRIGGLING HIS WAY BTWN SHE AND I TO HELP HOLD HIM DOWN. THE #4 FLT ATTENDANT RETURNED WITH THE CUFFS AS WELL AS SOME OTHER MEN (HELPERS). ONCE THE HELPERS HAD HOLD OF HIM; I MOVED BACK TO THE LAVATORY AREA. I CHIMED THE COCKPIT TO TELL THEM WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I WAS SHAKING SO THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SAID. I THEN REALIZED THAT ANOTHER FLT ATTENDANT WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THEM ALREADY. I THEN THOUGHT AND PAGED FOR A DOCTOR OR NURSE. I NOTICED THAT MOST OF THE AFT PART OF THE CABIN WAS UP IN THE AISLE AND I COULD NOT SEE IF ANYONE WAS COMING AND MADE ANOTHER PA FOR EVERYONE TO SIT DOWN AND EVERYTHING WAS OK. NO ONE CAME. I TURNED BACK TO THE INCIDENT; TO SEE THE HELPERS STRUGGLING STILL WITH THE MAN. HIS LEGS WERE FLAILING AND KICKING. I ASKED IF I SHOULD GET MY CUFFS FOR HIS ANKLE AND ALL AGREED. I WENT TO DOOR 2L TO GET MINE; AND AS I WAS COMING BACK; A MAN IN THE LHS WINDOW EXIT SAID HE WAS AN EMT AND IF I NEEDED HIS HELP. I TOOK HIM BACK AND BY THIS TIME THERE WAS A WOMAN THERE WHO ENDED UP BEING A PHARMACIST STANDING THERE. I TOLD THE GALLEY CROWD THAT THIS MAN WAS AN EMT. HE GOT INTO THE SITUATION. I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS NOW LIQUID FLOWING ON THE FLOOR. I ASKED THE CROWD WHAT WAS THAT; AND ONE OF THE HELPERS RESPONDED THAT IT WAS URINE. I GAVE MY CUFFS TO THE HELPER AND HE AND ANOTHER PUT THEM ON. I MADE SURE TO TELL HIM TO CHK TO SEE THAT HE SHOULD GET 1 FINGER BTWN THE CUFFS AND THE ANKLES. I NOTICED THAT THE MAN HAD ON 1 SHOE AT THIS POINT AND HIS FEET LOOKED SWOLLEN. I TOLD A HELPER TO REMOVE THE OTHER SHOE. I WAS CONCERNED THAT HE MIGHT HURT SOMEONE WITH THE SHOE STILL ON HIS FOOT. THE HELPER DID AND THE GUY REPEATEDLY TOLD HIM TO PUT IT BACK ON. I TOLD THE HELPER TO DO SO. THE #1 FLT ATTENDANT ASKED ME TO GET THE OXYGEN AND I GOT THE ONE FROM THE LHS DOGHOUSE. I TURNED IT ON; PINCHED THE BAG AND GAVE IT TO THE WOMAN. THE CAPT MADE THE PREPARE FOR LNDG ANNOUNCEMENT AND I WENT FORWARD TO DO MORE CHKS. WE UNFORTUNATELY HAD 15 UNACCOMPANIED MINORS; REPEAT 15 UNACCOMPANIED MINORS ON THIS FLT. FORTUNATELY; DURING BOARDING WE WERE ABLE TO GET THEM TOGETHER EXCEPT FOR TWO. I MOVED THE 2 TO FIRST CLASS; CLRED 36A-C; 35A-C TO FIRST CLASS TO ACCOMMODATE THE MAN AND THE HELPERS. WE SEATED THE MAN IN 36A; AND HELPERS IN 36BCD AND IN 35A&C. I ALSO WENT BACK TO THE COUPLE THAT WAS SITTING NEXT TO HIM AND ASKED IF HE HAD ANY BAGS AND WAS HE WITH THEM. THEY SAID NO TO EACH QUESTION; SAYING THAT THEY HAD SEEN HIM IN THE BOARDING AREA AND HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY BAGS WITH HIM. WHEN WE LANDED; WE WERE MET BY SOME TJSJ SUPVRS AND LOTS OF POLICE AND SOME PARAMEDICS. PARAMEDICS BOARDED AND TOOK HIM OFF. HIS DEMEANOR WAS NORMAL -- TOTALLY OPPOSITE OF THE ANGER WE HAD SEEN -- AND HIS APPEARANCE PHYSICALLY LOOKED AS IF HE HAD BEEN IN A FIGHT AND HE HAD ON 1 SET OF CUFFS ON HIS WRISTS. THE #2 FLT ATTENDANT AND I SPOKE TO POLICE AND THEY SAID THEY WANTED TO TAKE US TO THE STATION SINCE THIS WAS NOW AN FBI SITUATION. AFTER DEPLANING THE PAX AND THE 15 UNACCOMPANIED MINORS; SHE AND I WENT TO THE TJSJ POLICE STATION AT THE ARPT. WE WERE THERE OVER 3 HRS.

THEN WE TIRED TO GET A HOLD OF GATE CTLR TO GET HIS HELP WITH STATION CTL SO EVERYONE WOULD KNOW THE SEAT COULD NOT BE USED AND GOT NO ANSWER. WE WERE TOLD HE WENT HOME. DURING THIS TIME THE CAPT CAME DOWN TO THE GATE HOUSE AND INFORMED US THAT YET ANOTHER SEAT (2C) HAD NO POWER AND WOULD NOT RECLINE. WE WENT BACK UPSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT COULD BE DONE AND FOUND THIS SEAT HAD A POWER PROB. AND WOULD HAVE TO BE DEFERRED AS WELL. AGAIN WE TRIED CALLING GATE CTLR; OPS OR ANY MANAGEMENT PERSON TO HELP WITH THE DEFERRAL PROCESS OF THESE SEATS AND GOT NO ANSWER. WE FINALLY GOT THE SEAT 2C DEFERRED AND RELEASED THE AIRPLANE AS IT WAS PUSHING BACK. I THEN MADE AN INFO COMMENT IN THE DEFERRAL TEXT FOR SEAT 4A THAT THIS SEAT WAS UNUSABLE BECAUSE IT WAS STUCK IN THE BED ODE. AT APPROX XB30; OPS CALLED ME ON THE RADIO AND ASKED ME TO GIVE HIM A CALL ON THE PHONE. I TRIED CALLING AND GOT NO ANSWER; SO I CALLED MY SUPVR TO FIND OUT WHAT HE NEEDED. HE FINALLY GOT BACK TO ME AND TOLD ME TO CONTACT AN AIRFRAME CTLR IN LIE MAINT CTL. AIRFRAME CTLR TOLD ME THAT THE SEAT WE LET GO IN THE RECLINE OR BED POS WAS 'HIGHLY ILLEGAL AND COULDN'T BE ANY MOE ILLEGAL THAN THAT.' HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT I WOULD 'FRY' BECAUSE OF THIS.",,,,"A B757-200 WAS DISPATCHED WITH 2 FIRST CLASS SEATS INOP AND DEFERRED PER THE MEL.

I CONTACTED THE NOTAM DESK MYSELF SEVERAL WKS AGO TO GET THAT NOTAM PUT IN THE SYS. ARRIVING FROM THE N; THE FILED RTE (AND RTE I'VE ALWAYS FLOWN IN THE PAST) IS LTO.V4.SJD. THIS RTE IS ON THE SJD 347 DEG RADIAL AND OVERLAYS THE FINAL APCH COURSE TO THE VOR-DME 3 RWY 16 APCH. ON MY PRIOR FLTS TO SJD; WE WERE CLRED FOR THE VOR-DME 3 RWY 16 APCH VIA THE XOPRU TRANSITION; BASICALLY A STRAIGHT-IN APCH. TODAY; MAZATLAN CTR CHANGED THE FINAL PART OF OUR RTE TO READ 'LTO.V4.AMOKA..AVSOG.UJ23.SJD.' THIS RTE TOOK US WELL E OF OUR FILED RTE AND RESULTED IN US APCHING SJD ON THE SJD 022 DEG RADIAL FROM AVSOG. THE PROB HERE IS THAT THERE ARE NO APCH TRANSITIONS FROM THE SJD 022 DEG RADIAL. CONSEQUENTLY; WE FIGURED WE WOULD BE CLRED FOR THE VOR-DME 1 RWY 16 APCH USING SJD AS THE INITIAL FIX WITH A PROC TURN. ALTHOUGH THE ADVERTISED WX WAS VFR; VISIBILITY WAS ONLY ABOUT 10 MI BECAUSE OF THE TYPICAL HAZE LAYER. WE; THEREFORE; PLANNED TO SHOOT AN INST APCH UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WE CLRLY SAW THE ARPT AND IT WAS SAFE TO MANEUVER VISUALLY. WHEN WE CHKED IN WITH CABO APCH APPROX 70 MI N OF THE ARPT AT FL200; WE WERE TOLD TO EXPECT THE VOR-DME 1 RWY 16 APCH. THIS MADE SENSE TO US FOR THE REASONS STATED ABOVE. A FEW MINS LATER; WE WERE CLRED TO DSND TO 8000 FT AND TOLD TO RPT AT SJD 25 DME. THE PROB HERE IS THAT THE MEA ON UJ23 FROM AVSOG TO SJD IS 14000 FT (SEE THE 10-1B PAGE AND THE LATIN AMERICA #1 HIGH/LOW CHART). ALTHOUGH THE VOR-DME 2 RWY 16 CHART DEPICTS A 3100 FT PEAK IN THE APPROX LOCATION OF THE SJD 022 DEG RADIAL; WE COULDN'T DISCERN WHY THE MEA ON THAT RADIAL WAS AS HIGH AS 14000 FT. ABSENT ANY OTHER INFO AND KNOWING THAT WE WERE POINTED TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS; WE REFUSED THE CLRNC AND TOLD THE CTLR THAT WE WOULD ONLY DSND TO 14000 FT. ONCE AGAIN THE CTLR CLRED US TO 8000 FT; AND ONCE AGAIN WE REFUSED THE CLRNC. AFTER ANOTHER MIN; THE CTLR TOLD US TO 'MAINTAIN 14000 FT; TURN L (NO SPECIFIC HDG GIVEN) TO INTERCEPT THE SJD 041 DEG RADIAL AND RPT ESTABLISHED ON THE VOR-DME 2 RWY 16 APCH.' ONCE ESTABLISHED ON THE RADIAL; WE WERE CLRED FOR THE VOR-DME 2 RWY 16 APCH; 25 MI FROM THE ARPT AT 14000 FT. A TAD BIT HIGH; BUT DOABLE BECAUSE WE COULD LOSE ALT WHILE FLYING AROUND THE DME ARC. HOWEVER; WE HAD TO INITIATE THE APCH USING RAW DATA FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON: THE APCH 'VIA' SELECTIONS IN THE AIRBUS FMGC DO NOT MATCH THE TRANSITION FIX NAMES ON THE APCH CHARTS AT THIS ARPT. WE WERE LOOKING FOR THE VOR-DME 16 APCH VIA MENVI (AS DEPICTED ON THE 13-2 COMMERCIAL CHART); BUT IT WAS NOT LISTED. THIS IS ALL EASY TO FIGURE OUT WHEN YOU'RE AT CRUISE ALT; BUT IT'S TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCERN WHEN YOU'RE 25 MI FROM THE ARPT AT 14000 FT; AFTER BEING TOLD TO EXPECT 3 DIFFERENT APCHS; AND TRYING NOT TO HIT THE MOUNTAINS WHILE BEING VECTORED IN A NON RADAR ENVIRONMENT BELOW THE MEA. LONG STORY SHORT IS THAT WE STARTED THE APCH IN RAW DATA; WERE FINALLY ABLE TO LINE SELECT THE REST OF IT (THROUGH SHEER LUCK BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW WHICH TRANSITION TO PICK AND DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO RESEARCH IT); FLEW SOME OF IT IN NAV; AND THEN SAW THE ARPT WHILE WE WERE MAKING OUR WAY AROUND THE 11 DME ARC. THE REST OF THE APCH AND LNDG WERE UNEVENTFUL. THE PERFORMANCE OF SJD APCH CTL TODAY WAS TOTALLY SUB PAR; TO THE POINT OF BEING DANGEROUS. THEN WE WERE TOLD TO DSND BELOW THE MEA WHILE POINTED TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS. WHEN WE REFUSED DUE TO LACK OF APCH CTL RADAR SVCS; WE WERE GIVEN A PSEUDO VECTOR TO INTERCEPT THE VOR-DME 2 RWY 16 (JUST 'TURN L TO INTERCEPT' NO HDG GIVEN); WHICH WAS ALSO TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE IN A NON RADAR ENVIRONMENT. FINALLY; WE WERE LEFT FLYING A DME ARC IN RAW DATA BECAUSE OF BAD APCH TRANSITION CODING IN THE AIRBUS FMGC. AS TO BE EXPECTED; THE LANGUAGE BARRIER GREATLY EXACERBATED THESE EVENTS. INCIDENTALLY; WE WERE TOLD THAT THE INITIAL RERTE WAS DUE TO TFC; ALTHOUGH WE NEVER SAW OR HEARD ANY TFC IN THAT VICINITY. ATC'S 'COBBLE UP YOUR OWN APCH TRANSITION' THING INA MOUNTAINOUS NON RADAR ENVIRONMENT IS DANGEROUS AND NEEDS TO BE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY.

OUR HOSPITAL PAD IS LOCATED WITHIN THE ZZZ ARPT CLASS D AIRSPACE BOUNDARIES. WE COORD AT TKOF BY RADIO WITH TWR TO TRANSITION THROUGH THE AIRSPACE FOR EACH DEP. UPON RETURN; I CALLED TWR 12 MI S OF ZZZ AT 2500 FT FOR THE TRANSITION; NBOUND; TO THE HOSPITAL AND USED THE LIFEGUARD PREFIX TO MY CALL SIGN. I WAS GIVEN THE NORMAL TRANSITION INSTRUCTIONS THROUGH THE CLASS D AIRSPACE DIRECT TO THE PAD. AS I APCHED ZZZ; TWR GAVE AN IFR INBOUND CHALLENGER BIZJET CLRNC FOR A VISUAL APCH TO RWY 25 AND ASKED IF I HAD THE JET IN SIGHT. I RESPONDED THAT I DID; AND WAS ADVISED TO MAINTAIN VISUAL CONTACT AND SEPARATION FROM THE JET. I DID SO; AND CONTINUED MY DIRECT FLT TO THE HOSPITAL. THE CHALLENGER FLEW A STANDARD RECTANGULAR PATTERN AFTER PASSING OVERHEAD THE ARPT; USING L TURNS. AS THE CHALLENGER TURNED FINAL; IT BECAME APPARENT THAT OUR COMBINED SPD AND GND TRACKS WOULD BRING US CLOSER TOGETHER THAN IS NORMALLY DESIRED. I CALLED TWR TO ADVISE THAT I HAD THE TFC IN SIGHT AND WAS INITIATING A DSCNT INTO THE HOSPITAL PAD TO ENSURE ADEQUATE SEPARATION. APPARENTLY BASED ON A SUBSEQUENT PHONE CALL WITH THE TWR CTLR; HE HAD BECOME BUSY AND DISTR AND DID NOT SEE OUR CONVERGENCE DEVELOPING. WHEN HE DID RE-ESTABLISH VISUAL CONTACT; HIS VIEWING ANGLE DOWN RWY 25 CAUSED HIM TO THINK THAT AN NMAC WAS POSSIBLE. THE CTLR WAS MODERATELY UPSET WITH ME; IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT I HAD COMPLIED WITH HIS INSTRUCTIONS AND HAD INITIATED CORRECTIVE ACTION TO ENSURE ADEQUATE; IF MINIMAL; SEPARATION. I FEEL THAT THE SIT; WHILE UPSETTING TO THE CTLR; WAS NOT IN FACT AS POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS AS HIS PERCEPTION; AND THAT THE ENTIRE SIT DEVELOPED DUE TO HIS INAPPROPRIATE HANDLING OF VFR TFC. HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO BOTH ACFT RESULTED IN A FORESEEABLE; AND THUS AVOIDABLE; CONFLICT. AS A LIFEGUARD ACFT; I REALIZE THAT I AM NOT TO EXPECT SPECIAL HANDLING. IN THIS CASE; COMPLIANCE WITH TWR INSTRUCTIONS TO PROCEED DIRECT PLACED MY ACFT IN CONFLICT WITH ANOTHER ARRIVING ACFT. BY SIMPLY AMENDING MY CLRNC/INSTRUCTIONS; OR BY ASKING THE CHALLENGER TO EXTEND HIS DOWNWIND LEG SLIGHTLY; THE CTLR COULD HAVE AVOIDED THIS CONFLICT ALTOGETHER. THE CHALLENGER CREW MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE AWARE AND SIMPLY EXTENDED THEIR DOWNWIND TOO; BUT AS A NON LCL CREW; THEY COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO DO SO AND; IN MY OPINION; ARE NOT AT FAULT. MY JUDGEMENT IS THAT THE CTLR BECAME DISTR BY OTHER DUTIES; AFTER GIVING CLRNCS TO 2 ACFT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WOULD RESULT IN A COLLISION HAZARD. FAILING TO RECOGNIZE HIS INITIAL ERROR; HIS DIVERTED ATTN ALLOWED THE CONVERGENCE TO DEVELOP UNTIL I FELT THAT ACTION WAS NECESSARY. HAVING TAKEN THE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF BOTH ACFT; AND HAVING ADVISED THE CTLR OF THAT ACTION; THE CTLR NOW SEEMS TO HOLD THE OPINION THAT HE DID NOTHING WRONG; THAT ANY POTENTIAL HAZARD WAS MY FAULT; AND THAT MY ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE HAZARD WERE INAPPROPRIATE. GIVEN THE CURRENT REGULATORY/ENFORCEMENT CLIMATE; A USEFUL DIALOGUE WITH ATC REGARDING IMPROVED AND SAFER PROCS IS NOT POSSIBLE. NO ONE CAN AFFORD TO ACKNOWLEDGE AN ERROR OR ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY; BECAUSE IT COULD COST THEM THEIR JOB.

FROM CASANOVA; I PLANNED TO ENTER THE ADIZ AND FLY DIRECT TO THE DEST (MARYLAND ARPT). THE LEG FROM CASANOVA TO MARYLAND ARPT INCLUDED A SMALL BEND IN THE COURSE TO AVOID RESTR AREA R6608A. WHEN I RECEIVED THE CLRNC AT CARROLL COUNTY REGIONAL; IT WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE FLT PLAN I FILED. IT WAS MUCH SHORTER; ONLY 76 NM; WHICH I APPRECIATED; BUT ABOUT 90% OF THE NEW RTE ASSIGNED TO ME WAS INSIDE THE ADIZ; AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A PROB IN MY VIEW. THIS NEW FLT PLAN SPECIFIED THAT I 'ENTER CTLED AIRSPACE AT WESTMINSTER VOR; FLY DIRECT BAL; DIRECT OTT; DIRECT 2W5. MAINTAIN 3000 FT; EXPECT 5000 FT AFTER 10 MINS. CONTACT POTOMAC APCH ON 125.2; SQUAWK XXXX.' SHORTLY AFTER PASSING EMI; I WAS CLRED TO 6000 FT. WE CONTINUED TO BALTIMORE.

CONSEQUENTLY; AFTER ABORTING; I FLEW CIRCULARLY TWICE TO RE-ENTER FINAL. THIS RESULTED IN FLYING IN THE AREA LONGER THAN ORDINARILY WOULD BE NECESSARY TO LAND AFTER I CANCELED THE FLT PLAN.

HOWEVER; ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING; SEVERE WX HAD IMPACTED THE OP SUCH THAT MUCH OF NW ILLINOIS AND SOUTHERN WISCONSIN WERE IMBEDDED WITH TSTMS. DUE TO THE WX; I WAS FORCED TO HOLD A LARGE NUMBER OF ACFT INBOUND TO O'HARE. THIS NORMALLY WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT; BUT ON THIS SHIFT; SEVERAL FACTORS CREATED AN UNSAFE AND ULTIMATELY INJURIOUS ENVIRONMENT. FIRST; THE SUPVR IN CHARGE OF THE SHIFT WAS NEW (I BELIEVE IT WAS ONLY HIS SECOND NIGHT ON THE JOB. THIS WOULD NOT BE ALTOGETHER SIGNIFICANT IF THE SUPVR IN QUESTION WERE RIGHTLY TRAINED TO HANDLE OPS BEING IMPACTED BY SEVERE WX. THIS PERSON WAS NOT TRAINED APPROPRIATELY. FURTHER; NOT ONLY WAS HE ILL-EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THE MESS CAUSED BY A LARGE NUMBER OF ACFT BEING ROUTED THROUGH AREAS WHERE THEY ARE NOT NORMALLY ALLOWED; HE WAS UNABLE TO LEAD THE CTLRS HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR IN A SAFE PLAN OF ACTION TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY AS A TEAM (A CRUCIAL PART OF AIR TFC CTLING IS EVERY PART AND PERSON OF THE OP BEING 'ON THE SAME PAGE'). SECONDLY; DUE TO THE FACT I WAS FACED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF BEING ON MY OWN WITH NO SUPPORT FROM MY SUPVR; I WAS FORCED TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT MY OWN PLAN FOR HOLDING THE ACFT SOMEWHERE. AGAIN; IN MY YRS AS A CTLR; HOLDING ACFT IS SOMEWHAT ROUTINE: ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HOW OFTEN ORD ARPT IS OVERLOADED WITH ARR ACFT. HOWEVER; ON THIS NIGHT; CONSTANTLY CHANGING WX PATTERNS AND POP-UP TSTMS CREATED A SIT WHERE MY OPTIONS WERE FEW AND RAPIDLY DIMINISHING. I DID THE BEST I COULD TO PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT (FREE OF OTHER AIR TFC) FOR THE ACFT UNDER MY CTL TO HOLD. I WAS FORCED TO CHANGE MY PLAN SEVERAL TIMES IN ONLY A FEW MINS. ISSUING HOLDING INSTRUCTIONS TO ACFT IS TIME CONSUMING DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF INFO INVOLVED. HAVING TO ISSUE SEVERAL DIFFERENT SETS OF INSTRUCTIONS AT CHANGING GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS TO THE ACFT I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATED MUCH CONFUSION AND DISORDER ON THE RADIO FREQ I WAS UTILIZING. BUT; CONFUSION SEEMED TO BE THE ORDER OF THE DAY ON THIS PARTICULAR SHIFT. THIRDLY; HAVING ISSUED HOLDING INSTRUCTIONS TO THESE ACFT; I NOTICED AN ACFT HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE HOLDING PATTERN AIRSPACE AT THE SAME ALT AS ANOTHER ACFT THAT WAS UNDER MY CTL. THIS WAS TROUBLING AND POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS. I WAS UNABLE TO COM VERBALLY WITH THIS PLANE (I ASSUME ANOTHER CTLR WAS COMMUNICATING WITH IT ON A DIFFERENT FREQ). NEXT; WHEN MY ASSISTANT CTLR TRIED TO CALL THE PERSON WORKING THE ADJACENT AIRSPACE TO OURS TO ISSUE CTL INSTRUCTIONS AND ALERT THAT CTLR TO THE FACT THAT WE HAD 2 PLANES HEAD-ON AT THE SAME ALT; ALL I COULD HEAR WAS YELLING. I DON'T KNOW IF MY ASSISTANT EVER GOT THROUGH TO THIS OTHER CTLR WHO SHOULD HAVE MADE PRIOR COORD WITH US BEFORE HIS ACFT ENTERED OUR AIRSPACE; BUT THE OTHER CTLR DIDN'T MAKE THAT COORD. IN RETROSPECT; I DON'T REMEMBER HOW WE GOT OUT OF THIS SIT. I MIGHT HAVE CHANGED THE ALT OF THE ACFT I WAS COMMUNICATING WITH; OR I MIGHT HAVE POSSIBLY TURNED HIM OUT OF THE WAY. (IT'S SCARY TO ME THAT I DON'T REMEMBER.) FORTUNATELY; SOMEHOW I WAS ABLE TO MANAGE THE SIT WITHOUT LOSS OF PAX LIFE OR 'OPERROR.'

WE CALLED MAINT AND THE MECH ARRIVED AND TOOK THE LOGBOOK ONTO THE JETBRIDGE AND BEGAN TO PLACARD THE LOW PRESSURE LIGHT INOP AGAIN.

SINCE THERE WAS ONLY THE 2 OF US DOING THIS CHK INSTEAD OF A FULL CHK CREW; WE DECIDED TO DO THE CHK OUTSIDE AT THE GATE WHERE IT CAME IN TO SAVE THE TIME THAT TOWING WOULD TAKE FROM US TOWING IT TO THE HANGAR AND THEN BACK IN THE MORNING. WE SPLIT THE TASK CARDS BTWN US; WITH MR X HAVING ALL THE INTERIOR CARDS; AND MYSELF HAVING THE EXTERIOR CARDS. AFTER COMPLETING ALL OF THE TASK CARDS; THE ONLY WRITE-UP I HAD WAS THE 'INBOARD SIDE OF #2 NOSE COWL EXTERIOR HAS 15 LOOSE AND PULLED THROUGH RIVETS.' I RPTED THE DISCREPANCY TO THE LEAD; MR Y. HE THEN ORDERED THE NOSE COWL FROM STORES. I PULLED UP THE MAINT MANUAL REF AND WENT BACK TO THE ACFT AND STARTED TO STRIP THE COWLING FROM THE ENG. AT APPROX XA00 I WAS DOWN TO JUST THE INBOARD UPPER COWL; AND THE NOSE COWL. MR X HAD FINISHED THE INTERIOR AND TOGETHER WE FINISHED STRIPPING THESE 2 COWLS FROM THE ENG; LEAVING THE NOSE COWL ATTACHED WITH 1 BOLT ON EACH SIDE. WHILE WE WERE DOING THIS; STORES PULLED UP AND DELIVERED THE CRATED NOSE COWL. WE THEN LOOKED AT THE INVENTORY TAG ON THE CRATE WHICH STATED THAT IT CONTAINED 'ACR #123; TT#X; SERIAL NUMBER X NOMENCLATURE COWL R-HAND NOSE.' AFTER UNCRATING THE COWL; WE FOUND THAT IT HAD AN ANTI-FOD BOOM INSTALLED ON IT. ACFT X IS NOT EQUIPPED FOR THAT SYS; SO WE REMOVED THE BOOM AND INSTALLED THE BLANKING PLATE. WE THEN USED THE LID FROM THE CRATE TO SET THE OLD NOSE COWL ON WHEN WE REMOVED IT FROM THE ENG. I REMOVED THE TRACKING TAG FROM THE NEW COWL; TAKING THE STICKER OFF AND ATTACHING THE TAG TO THE OLD COWL WITH THE TAPE THAT WAS ON IT. AT THIS POINT IT WAS APPROX XA15; THE WX WAS HVY CLOUDS BUT NO RAIN; LIGHTING WAS DIM. WHILE DOING THIS; I DID NOT NOTICE THAT THE LAST DIGIT WAS A 'B' INSTEAD OF AN 'A' AS THE CRATE TAG HAD INDICATED. WE THEN INSTALLED THE NOSE COWL ONTO THE ENG. NORMALLY; WITH JUST 2 OF US DOING THIS IT WOULD HAVE TYPICALLY TAKEN A BIT OF MAN HANDLING TO GET A BOLT STARTED; HOWEVER; ON THIS OCCASION THE COWL LINED UP PERFECTLY AND I WAS ABLE TO START A BOLT AND LOOSELY TIGHTEN IT TO SECURE THE OUTBOARD SIDE. I THEN MOVED AROUND TO THE SIDE THAT MR X WAS HOLDING UP AND STARTED A BOLT THERE ON THE INBOARD SIDE AND LIGHTLY TIGHTENED IT. WE THEN INSTALLED THE REST OF THE BOLTS AND CONNECTED THE ANTI-ICE DUCTS LOOSELY. ABOUT THIS TIME; MR X CAME OUT TO HELP. ALL BOLTS AND THE DUCTS WERE TORQUED TO SPEC AND THEN WE INSTALLED THE ENG BODY COWLS. THE TIME WAS NOW APPROX XB20 AND WE WENT INSIDE TO EAT LUNCH. AFTER LUNCH; I COMPLETED THE PAPERWORK AND ENTERED IT ALL ONTO COMPUTER. MR X HAD GONE OUT AND CRATED UP THE OLD COWL WHILE I WAS DOING THIS. ONCE THE LEAD COMPLETED THE PACKAGE AND LOGBOOK; I DELIVERED THE LOGBOOK TO THE ACFT. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 662785: AFTER ARR IN ZZZ1; I WAS ADVISED BY A MAINT SPECIALIST THAT THE WRONG ENG COWLING NOSE SECTION (THE COWLING LIP; NOT THE BULLET NOSE) HAD BEEN INSTALLED ON THE R ENG OF ACFT X ON JUN/TUE/05. APPARENTLY; A L ENG FORWARD COWL HAD SOMEHOW BEEN INSTALLED ON THE R ENG. THE ACFT FLEW NORMALLY; AND WAS IN-RIG WITH THE AILERON AND RUDDER TRIMS NEAR ZERO.

I CALLED DISPATCH AND THE MAINT ENG CTLR REGARDING A LINE MAINT ITEM THAT SHOWED UP IN THE COMPUTER THAT WAS NOT ON THE ACFT'S LOG HISTORY IN THE FLT PAPERS. THE LINE MAINT ITEM STATED 'RPL #2 ENG *ZZZ1 ONLY RPL #2 ENG PER MM 71-00-02 AT ZZZ1 ONLY WITH NEXT AVAILABLE SPARE. ENG CONDITION MONITOR FLAG COMPRESSOR STALLS.' MY QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE COMPRESSOR STALLS AND MAINT SAID IT IS EXPERIENCING A SERIES OF SMALL COMPRESSOR STALLS PROBABLY DUE TO ENG DETERIORATION OVER TIME AND IT SHOULD NOT BE A PROB. THESE HAPPEN ALL THE TIME AND THE ENG PARAMETERS ARE NOT AFFECTED. SO I ASKED AGAIN; ARE THESE COMPRESSOR STALLS; AND HE SAID YES. DUE TO THE HISTORY OF THE PW 4000 SERIES ENGS AND COMPRESSOR STALL PROBS; I WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TAKING THE AIRPLANE INTO ETOPS AIRSPACE. THE CTLR SAID THAT IT WAS NOT ACTUALLY A DEFERRED ITEM BUT A LINE MAINT NOTE. THAT IS WHY IT DID NOT SHOW UP IN THE FLT PAPERS LOG HISTORY. I SAID THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE A PROB TAKING THIS DOMESTICALLY OR OVER LAND; BUT I WAS REFUSING THE ACFT FOR AN ETOPS FLT. THEN I SPOKE TO AN ACFT ROUTER AND HE SAID THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY AIRPLANES HE COULD SWAP TO AND IT WAS GOING TO BE A PROB. I AGAIN STATED THAT I HAD REFUSED ACFT X. WE STAYED IN OPS; ABOUT 15 MINUTES LATER AN ENG MAINT SUPVR CALLED AND TRIED TO TALK ME INTO TAKING THE AIRPLANE. HE SAID THESE EVENTS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME; AND NORMALLY WE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT. I TELL HIM THAT I AM CONCERNED THAT THESE EVENTS DO HAPPEN AND THERE MAY BE AN EFFORT TO KEEP THIS INFO FROM THE FLT CREWS. THE SUPERVISOR THEN SAID THAT THIS ENTRY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PHRASED IN THIS MANNER. I AGAIN ASKED IF IT WAS COMPRESSOR STALLING; AND HE SAID YES. THEN HE ASKED IF HE WERE TO CHANGE THE WORDING IN THE LINE MAINT ITEM; WHAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE FOR ME TO TAKE THE PLANE. I ASKED AGAIN; 'IS IT STILL STALLING?' HE SAID YES; THEN I SAID NO CHANGE WOULD WORK. UNFORTUNATELY; I WAS A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS THAT HE WAS FISHING FOR WORDING TO CHANGE THE LINE MAINT ITEM AND GET ANOTHER CREW TO TAKE THE PLANE. LATER; I CALLED OPS AND FOUND THAT THEY DID FIND ANOTHER 767-300 WE COULD SWAP TO. THIS WAS AN ACCEPTABLE PLANE FOR THE ETOPS FLT. I LATER FOUND OUT THAT THIS AIRPLANE WAS SCHEDULED TO FLY A LATER OVER WATER FLT. I THOUGHT MAINT MIGHT TRY TO SWITCH PLANES AND TRY TO GET THAT CREW TO TAKE ACFT X ON THE LATER FLT. THIS WAS BORNE OUT WHEN WE CHKED THE ACFT IN ACARS FOR THAT FLT. THE COPLT AND I WERE SO CONCERNED THAT WE TOOK THE TIME TO CALL OPS TO TALK TO THE CREW AND TELL THEM WHY WE HAD REFUSED ACFT X FOR THE ETOPS FLT. THAT CREW SAID THAT THEY TALKED TO MAINT AND HE SAID THAT IT WAS A NORMAL PROB; PROBABLY A BLEED VALVE OR SOMETHING; AND THAT THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND WE USUALLY NEVER KNOW ABOUT IT AND IT WAS A MISTAKE TO INCLUDE THAT WORDING ON THE LINE MAINT ITEM. THE LINE MAINT ITEM WORDING WAS CHANGED FROM 'ECM FLAG COMPRESSOR STALLS' TO THE FOLLOWING: 'RPL #2 ENG *ZZZ1 ONLY RPL #2 ENG PER MM 71-00-02 AT ZZZ1 ONLY WITH NEXT AVAILABLE SPARE. LABEL REASON FOR REMOVAL AS 'PERFORMANCE DETERIORATION.' TRENDING UP TO PREVENT IRREG OPS AND CANCELLATIONS; ACCOMPLISHED ENG2 OIL SYS STATIC LEAK CHK.' WHEN I CHKED THE ACFT'S HISTORY TODAY TO GET FURTHER DOCUMENTATION ON THE LINE MAINT WORDING CHANGE; I NOTED AN ADDITIONAL LINE MAINT ITEM; THE ONE ABOUT INCREASED OIL CONSUMPTION. I RHETORICALLY ASK; 'WHY ARE WE FLYING THIS ACFT ON ETOPS RTES?' THIS IS AN INCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN. EITHER RESTRICT THE PLANE TO NON-ETOPS FLTS; OR CHANGE THE ENG. MY WORRIES ARE THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT SPENDING ENOUGH MONEY ON SPARE PARTS AND ENGS TO ADEQUATELY SUPPLY OUR ACTIVE FLT OPS. SINCE THERE IS A LACK OF PARTS; MAINT IS PUSHING FLT CREWS TO TAKE ACFT ON ETOPS FLTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE SCHEDULED IN THE FIRST PLACE; LET ALONE QUESTION A FLT CREW'S DECISION TO REFUSE AN ACFT. THE CHANGING OF MAINT WRITE-UPS TO EITHER CONCEAL INFO FROM THE FLT CREWS OR CHANGE THE WORDING OF AN EXISTING CONDITION TO MAKEIT MORE ACCEPTABLE FOR THE FLT CREW WHILE NOT ACTUALLY FIXING THE PROB. BY CHANGING THE LINE MAINT ITEM WORDING TO 'PERFORMANCE DETERIORATION' ACTUALLY VIOLATES ETOPS RULES. IF ENG #1 SHOULD FAIL ON THE ETOPS PORTION OF THE FLT; THE WORDING OF 'PERFORMANCE DETERIORATION' TO ME SAYS THAT THE ENG IS NO LONGER CAPABLE OF ITS RATED PERFORMANCE AND THUS IS NOT CAPABLE OF MAINTAINING RATED THRUST DURING AN ENG FAILURE AT THE PET AND NOT ABLE TO MAINTAIN DRIFT-DOWN ALTS. THEREBY INVALIDATING ETOPS FLT RULES AND NOT HAVING ENOUGH FUEL AT ETP TO RETURN. THIS WORDING IS ACTUALLY WORSE FOR ME THAN A SERIES OF INCONSEQUENTIAL COMPRESSOR STALLS. I UNDERSTAND THE NEW ECONOMIC REALITIES OF THE AIRLINE BUSINESS. WE ARE A FINANCIALLY TROUBLED AIRLINE AND CONSEQUENTLY DO NOT HAVE EXTRA FUNDS FOR MAINT. HOWEVER; IF WE ARE SKIMPING ON SPARES OR ARE PUSHING CREWS TO TAKE PLANES WITH MARGINALLY ACCEPTABLE RISKS; ESPECIALLY ON ETOPS FLTS; WE WILL HAVE A HULL LOSS SOON. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR ADVISED THE ACFT CONTINUED TO OPERATE WITH THE DEGRADED ENG INSTALLED UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE FOLLOWING MONTH AT WHICH TIME THE ENG WAS REPLACED. HE ADVISED THIS ACR HAS ELIMINATED THE PAPER LOGBOOK FROM THE ACFT AND THE ONLY INFO ROUTINELY AVAILABLE TO FLT CREWS IS THE DATA ENTERED INTO THE MAINT COMPUTER BY MAINT PERSONNEL. ACCESS TO ANY ACTUAL FLT CREW WRITE-UP IS THUS AVAILABLE THROUGH SPECIFIC FLT CREW REQUESTS WHEN A COMPANY COMPUTER IS ACCESSIBLE.

THERE WAS NO SUPVR WORKING THIS SHIFT. DURING PREVIOUS SHIFT; THE ROAD TRIP WAS SET UP; BUT FOR SOME REASON THE MECHS DID NOT MAKE THE FLT. SINCE THE TRACKING SHEET HAD NO INFO ON WHAT WAS THE PROB; I ELECTED TO CALL CONTRACT MAINT BACK OUT TO GIVE THE MEL PROC ANOTHER TRY. BOTH METHOD #1 AND METHOD #2 MEL PROCS WERE FAILING AT THE SAME STEP. THE GUST LOCK LEVER WAS LOCKING WHEN IT SHOULD NOT BE LOCKING. SOMEONE ALREADY HAD ORDERED THE SOLENOID; SO WE LET THAT CONTINUE. I ALSO TALKED WITH MR X AND I BELIEVE HE ALSO TOLD ME THE SOLENOID WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO START. I ALSO BELIEVE HE TOLD ME THAT THE QUADRANT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE REMOVED TO REPLACE THE SOLENOID. I TOLD HIM MAINT IS TELLING US IT DOES. AGAIN HE TOLD ME THEY WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE THE WHOLE QUADRANT ASSEMBLY AND NEEDED RII. I ASKED IF ANY RII PEOPLE WOULD GO. HE TOLD ME HIS RII WOULD BE COMING IN 10 MINS. I TOLD HIM TO ASK THE RII MECH TO GO. HE CALLED BACK AND SAID THE RII WOULD NOT GO. I THEN CALLED MR Y AND ASKED IF HE HAD ANY OTHER IDEAS; OF IF WE COULD GET A DI/TEMP RII FOR SOMEONE ELSE. I TOLD HIM I WAS NOT 100% SURE THE CONTRACT MAINT WAS DOING THE MEL PROC CORRECTLY. SO HE DECIDED TO JUST SEND 1 MECH UP TO EVALUATE THE SIT. SO WE GOT THE SAME MECH THAT MISSED THE EARLIER FLT ON THE LAST DEP. THE FLT HAD ALREADY DEPARTED THE GATE; BUT WE CALLED IT BACK TO GET THE MECH ON THE FLT. AFTER HE ARRIVED; HE EVALUATED THE ACFT AND CONFIRMED THE SOLENOID WAS BAD. I BELIEVE THE CTLR ASKED HIM IF HE COULD CHANGE THE SOLENOID WITHOUT TAKING THE QUADRANT OUT. I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO LOOK AT IT AND CALL US BACK. AT THAT TIME I STARTED TO CHK ON CHARTERS TO SEND AN RII UP IN CASE IT WAS REQUIRED. I CALLED AND TALKED TO MR Z. HE TOLD ME MECH HAS DONE A FEW OF THOSE SOLENOIDS; AND THEY NEVER USE AN RII. HE TOLD ME THEY NEVER REMOVE THE QUADRANT. HE TALKED IT OVER WITH SOMEONE ELSE; AND HE ALSO SAID RII NOT REQUIRED. THIS COULD BE A GRAY AREA. WE DID LOOK IN THE GPM; BUT UNDER CHAPTER 76 IT JUST SAYS RII FOR INSTALLATION AND RIG. I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING UNDER CHAPTER 27 FOR GUST LOCK. SO AS LONG AS THE QUADRANT WAS NOT REMOVED WE DID NOT NEED AN RII. THE TIME FRAME (MAYBE LESS THAN 1 HR) I COULD NOT REMEMBER; BUT IT SEEMED VERY SHORT. I RECALL HIM TELLING ME THE MECH ALREADY HAD THE SOLENOID OUT. I DID NOT ASK; NOR DO I REMEMBER IF HE ASKED THE MECH IF HE HAD TO PULL THE QUADRANT OUT. SINCE I TALKED IT OVER WITH HIM ON THE RII ISSUE; I FIGURED IF HE AT ALL TOLD ME HE REMOVED THE QUADRANT; WE WOULD HAVE STOPPED AND SENT AN RII. SO EVERYTHING CONTINUED ON; AND THE INSTALLATION WENT GREAT; AND EVERYTHING WAS WORKING. I DID NOT HEAR ANYTHING THE REST OF THE NIGHT. THE NEXT EVENING I TALKED TO MR X AND HE TOLD ME HE AND MR Y HAD ISSUES IN THE MORNING ABOUT THE RII. THE MECH MISSED HIS FLT BACK BECAUSE MAINT CALLED THEM AND SAID AN RII WAS NEEDED. THEY CALLED A FEW OTHER BASES; AND EVERYONE AGREED RII WAS NOT NEEDED. I DO NOT KNOW IF THEY ASKED THE MECH IF HE REMOVED THE QUADRANT OR NOT. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 662287: IN MY FINAL DISCUSSION; I WAS LEFT WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS REPLACING ONLY THE SOLENOID AND HAD NOT REMOVED THE QUADRANT. APPARENTLY HE DID REMOVE THE QUADRANT TO REPLACE THE SOLENOID.

THE SAIL MISSED CLEARING THE CANOPY BY ABOUT 2 INCHES IN HEIGHT. THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ANY DAMAGE TO THE ACFT.

THERE HAD BEEN SEVERE WX IN THE ZZZ AREA FOR DAYS AND IT WAS STILL THERE. DURING CLB OUT; AFTER THE RELIEF PLT LEFT TO TAKE HIS BREAK; WE WERE IN HEAVY RAIN AND MASSIVE ST ELMO'S FIRE; LOTS OF LIGHTNING AND MODERATE CHOP/TURB. WE WERE CLBING THROUGH FL270 AND DOING 270 KTS WITH THE AUTOPLT ON. AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES OF THIS THERE WAS A STRONG BURNING SMELL IN THE COCKPIT. I HAD EXPERIENCED THIS BEFORE IN THE 757 DURING ST ELMO'S FIRE; BUT THE COPLT HADN'T. THE SMELL GOT STRONGER AND THEN THE CAPT'S AIRSPD INDICATOR INDICATED ABOUT 120 KTS. THEN MY ALTIMETER FAILED. I GOT A FLASHING 'FAST SLOW' INDICATOR. WE THEN GOT A 'RUDDER RATIO' AND 'MACH SPD TRIM' WARNING ON THE EICAS. THEN MORE INSTRUMENTS FAILED. THE COPLT'S AIRSPD WAS INDICATING FASTER THAN NORMAL. MORE ELECTRICAL INSTRUMENTS SEEMED TO BE FAILING OR GIVING FALSE INFO ON MY SIDE AND THE PROB WAS SPREADING TO THE COPLT'S SIDE. THERE WERE MORE EICAS WARNINGS THAN WE COULD READ. THEN THE AUTOPLT DID A PITCH UP OF OVER 10 DEGS AND WE GOT A STRONG; VIOLENT BUFFET. I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT. WE DECLARED AN EMER TO RETURN TO ZZZ. PROB; RADIOS SEEMED TO HAVE FAILED. (WE LATER FOUND OUT THE FLT ATTENDANT TRIED TO CALL US BUT COULDN'T.) ON STANDBY INSTRUMENTS; I SLOWLY TURNED BACK TO ZZZ. THERE WAS ANOTHER EXTREME BUFFET AND THE ENTIRE AIRPLANE SHOOK. MY OPINION IS THAT BOTH TIMES AUTOSLATS EXTENDED OR WERE TRYING TO EXTEND. AFTER REPEATED CALLS; THE RADIO STARTED TO WORK. WE TOLD ZZZ OF OUR PROB AND OUR INTENTION TO RETURN. AN EMER WAS OFFICIALLY DECLARED. THE COPLT WAS NOW ABLE TO CONTACT THE RELIEF PLT AND WE LET HIM AND THE FLT ATTENDANT IN THE COCKPIT. DURING THIS TIME; INSTRUMENTS WERE STARTING TO COME BACK; ONE BY ONE. THE BURNING SMELL WAS ALSO GOING AWAY. I BRIEFED THE FLT ATTENDANT AND THE RELIEF PLT TOOK A POSITION TO HELP US. BY THE TIME WE WERE ESTABLISHED BACK TO ZZZ; ALL WARNINGS STARTED TO GO AWAY AND EVERYTHING WORKED NORMALLY. WE NOW HAD TO RE-PENETRATE AND DEV THROUGH THE WX WE HAD JUST COME THROUGH. ALL CHKLISTS WERE DONE AND WE LANDED OVERWEIGHT BY ABOUT 31000 POUNDS. BY THE TIME OF OUR RETURN; EVERYTHING WORKED NORMALLY. THE LNDG WAS EXTREMELY SMOOTH ON A VERY WET RWY. FIRE RESCUE WAS STANDING BY AND FOLLOWED US IN AS A PRECAUTION FROM BRAKE FIRE OR BLOWN TIRES. THERE WERE NO PROBS. WE PARKED AT THE GATE AND PAX DEPLANED AND ANOTHER ACFT WAS FOUND. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING (UNCONFIRMED) THAT MAINT FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE ACFT. THE ONLY EXPLANATION THAT I OR EITHER COPLT CAN COME UP WITH IS THAT THERE WAS A MASSIVE STATIC BUILDUP/DISCHARGE OR LIGHTNING STRIKE THAT TEMPORARILY KNOCKED OUT MOST OF OUR ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. THERE WAS NO LOUD BANG OR SOUND NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A LIGHTNING STRIKE OR STATIC DISCHARGE. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR ADVISED THE ACFT RECEIVED AN EXTENSIVE MAINT INSPECTION BASED ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A LIGHTNING STRIKE. HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THE FLT DATA RECORDER WAS PULLED OR READ. HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FAILURE TO DO SO BECAUSE HE REMAINS CONVINCED THE BUFFETS AND PITCH-UPS NOTED IN THE RPT WERE THE LIKELY RESULT OF AUTOSLAT DEPLOYMENT ACTING IN RESPONSE TO THE INACCURATELY DEGRADED CAPT'S IAS. HE STATED THAT IF; IN FACT; THE SLATS HAD DEPLOYED AT THE 270 KIAS SHOWN ON THE STANDBY IAS INDICATOR; THE FLAP/SLAT EXTENSION SPD LIMITATION WAS GROSSLY EXCEEDED AND WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A SPECIFIC AND SEPARATE INSPECTION. HE FEELS THIS MAY NOT HAVE RISEN TO THE ATTENTION OF MAINT BECAUSE HIS LOG BOOK WRITE UP WAS A SINGLE ENTRY ADDRESSING THE ENTIRE EPISODE RATHER THAN THE DISTINCT ENTRY FOR EACH ANOMALY. HE FURTHER STATED THAT HE HAD SPOKEN WITH ANOTHER B757-200 FLT CREW WHICH EXPERIENCED A NEARLY IDENTICAL EXPERIENCE IN THE SAME GENERAL AIRSPACE/WX AREA THE AFTERNOON OF THE RPTED FLT (WHICH OCCURRED THE SAME DAY SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT).

AFTER THE SEATBELT SIGN WAS TURNED OFF; I RELEASED MY SEATBELTS; TURNED ON THE CABIN LIGHTING 'MAIN ON' BUTTON AND TOOK THE INTERPHONE IN HAND. I LEANED INTO THE 1L DOOR WINDOW TO VIEW THE APCHING JETWAY. AS I SAW THE JETBRIDGE ALIGNING WITH THE PLANE DOOR; I MADE THE PA ANNOUNCEMENT FOR FLT ATTENDANTS TO DISARM DOORS. AS I LEANED INTO THE WINDOW; I HAD MY L HAND NEAR THE DOOR HANDLE AND INADVERTENTLY TOOK HOLD OF IT AND BEGAN TO PULL ON IT. I MOVED THE HANDLE UPWARD APPROX 3-4 INCHES AND REALIZED I HAD INITIATED THE DOOR OPENING WHILE ARMED. I FELT THE TUG/RESISTANCE ON THE DOOR TO PULL AWAY FROM THE FRAME; BUT I HELD FIRM AND WAS ABLE TO GRASP THE ASSIST HANDLE ON THE DOOR AND SECURE MY FOOTING TO KEEP THE DOOR FROM OPENING FURTHER I WAS THEN HOLDING THE ASSIST HANDLE WITH MY L HAND AND DISARMED THE DOOR WITH MY R HAND THOUGH THE DOOR WAS OUT FROM ITS FRAME APPROX 6-8 INCHES TO WHERE I COULD SEE THE GIRT BAR. MY FIRST CONCERN WAS TO HOLD THE DOOR AND KEEP THE SLIDE PACK FROM FALLING OUT FROM BELOW THE DOOR TO ALLOW THE CUSTOMER SVC AGENT TIME TO RETRACT AWAY THE JETBRIDGE FROM THE PLANE. THE SLIDE PACK WAS NOT OUT YET FROM ITS HOUSING. ONCE THE JETWAY WAS CLR I CONSIDERED THE POSITIONING OF MY HOLD ON THE DOOR; FOOTING AND ABILITY TO MAINTAIN MY OWN SAFETY. I WAS NOT SURE IF THE SLIDE PACK; NOT HAVING FALLEN OUT OR INFLATED YET COULD BE SALVAGED AND DETACHED/REATTACHED; SO I FELT I SHOULD MAINTAIN THE HOLD I HAD ON THE DOOR FOR AS LONG AS I COULD OR UNTIL I FELT IT WAS UNSAFE FOR ME TO DO SO. AS XXX WAS HELPING ME TO TRY TO SECURE THE DOOR; IT KEPT BUDGING AWAY. JUST THEN I HEARD THE SLIDE BEGIN TO HISS AS THE PACK HAD FALLEN OUT FURTHER UNBEKNOWNST TO ME. MECHS WHO WERE ON THE TARMAC AT A DISTANCE WERE SURVEYING THE CONDITION OF THE SLIDE AND ITS POSITION AS THE FIRST CARTRIDGE BEGAN TO HISS. THEY IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME TO JUST LET IT GO. I KNEW THEN THE SLIDE WOULD HAVE TO BE INFLATED. I RELEASED THE DOOR THEN DISARMED DOOR 1R. THE SLIDE FULLY INFLATED AND MECHS TOLD ME TO PULL THE DETACH CORD TO DROP THE INFLATED SLIDE DOWN TO THE TARMAC. I DID SO; THEN REMOVING THE GIRT BAR FROM THE FLOOR BRACKETS. WE BEGAN TO DEPLANE ONCE THE JETBRIDGE WAS BROUGHT TO ABUT THE PLANE. I WAS ASKED TO IMMEDIATELY WRITE A STATEMENT AND WAS TAKEN BY XXX TO BE DRUG TESTED. IN TOTAL I MUST HAVE HELD ONTO THE DOOR FOR 20 OR MORE MINS. I ARRIVED AT THE MEDICAL FACILITY AT ABOUT XB10. I LEFT THE FACILITY ABOUT XB45 AND WAS AT MY LAYOVER HOTEL BY XC00. I JUDGE THE ACTUAL TIME THE SLIDE BEGAN TO INFLATE AT ABOUT XA20. REASONS FOR WHY I INADVERTENTLY GRABBED HOLD OF THE DOOR OPENING ARM AS I NOW THINK ABOUT IT OVER AND OVER IN MY MIND MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT I LEANED INTO THE WINDOW SUPPORTING MYSELF WITH MY L-HAND NEAR THE DOOR HANDLE TO ASSESS THE APCH OF THE JETWAY AS WE ARE TRAINED TO DO. THE CLOSEST HANDLE USING THE SAME MOTION USED TO DISARM THE A319 DOOR IS AN UPWARD MOTION. IT WAS EASILY CONFUSED IN THE SPLIT SECOND. THE FAMILIARITY ALSO TO WHICH THE MOTION OF OPENING THE DOOR IS LINKED TO LOOKING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW IN THE POSTURE TO ASSESS THE APCHING JETBRIDGE WAS NEWLY FAMILIAR TO ME FROM THE MANY TIMES I HAD BOTH PHYSICALLY PRACTICED AND MENTALLY PRACTICED THIS OPENING PROC IN TRAINING THAT I HAD JUST COMPLETED. IRONIC AS THE RELATIVE TIMING OF MY TRAINING IS TO THE EVENT OF DEPLOYING THE SLIDE; THE MENTAL CONNECTION TO OPENING THE DOOR WAS INNATELY NATURAL IN THAT SPLIT SECOND.

FOR THE PURPOSE OF A PRE-BUY INSPECTION; THE ACFT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPOSITIONED TO A SMALL GRASS STRIP 7 MI S OF ZZZ. THIS ARPT IS IDENTED AS ZZZ3. I NEEDED TO GET THE ACFT FROM ZZZ3 BACK TO ZZZ FOR THE PURPOSE OF FILING AN IFR FLT PLAN AND TO PURCHASE FUEL. MY INITIAL PLAN WAS TO MAKE THE 5 MIN FLT TO ZZZ UNDER VFR; AND THEN FROM THERE I WOULD FILE IFR TO MAKE THE 1394 NM TRIP WITH INTERMEDIATE FUEL STOPS. I DEPARTED VFR FROM ZZZ3 AND TUNED IN THE ATIS. I LEARNED THAT ZZZ WAS CONDUCTING IFR OPS. (MUCH TO MY SURPRISE!) THEY WERE RPTING A 900 FT OVCST CEILING AND 2 MI VISIBILITY. I CONTACTED THE TWR AND TOLD THEM THAT I WANTED TO LAND VISUALLY. THE TWR RESPONDED THAT THEY WERE UNDER IFR AND HANDED ME OFF TO CENTER. THERE WAS SOME REAL TENTATIVENESS IN MY VOICE WHEN THE CTLR HEARD ME SPEAK AND THIS MAY HAVE ALARMED THEM. I WAS THEN GIVEN AN IFR CLRNC AND A SQUAWK CODE. I REQUESTED AN ILS TO ZZZ AND WAS GIVEN RADAR VECTORS FOR THE ILS APCH. I WAS THEN HANDED BACK OFF TO THE TWR; FLEW THE ILS APCH AND LANDED. THE TWR PROCEEDED TO QUERY ME (MY NAME; HOME BASE; AND WHETHER OR NOT IF I WAS INST RATED). I RESPONDED THAT I WAS AN INST RATED; COMMERCIAL PLT. THE CTLR CHIDED ME FOR FLYING 1 MI INSIDE OF THEIR AIRSPACE WITHOUT A CLRNC. I SIMPLY APOLOGIZED TO HIM. THERE WAS NO FURTHER INQUIRY FROM THE TWR. THE PROB AROSE FROM THE FACT THAT I WAS IN A HURRY TO GET THE ACFT BACK TO AN ADEQUATE FACILITY FOR FUELING AND FLT PLANNING. INITIALLY; I HAD NEGLECTED TO FILE AN IFR FLT PLAN ON THE GND PRIOR TO DEP. I FIGURED THAT SINCE IT WAS SUCH A SHORT FLT; IT DID NOT REQUIRE SUCH INTENSIVE FLT PLANNING. MY MINDSET WAS; 'I CAN GET IN UNDER VFR AND LAND VISUALLY.' THIS ILLUSION WAS QUICKLY SHATTERED AND THE REALITY OF BEING IN 'UNEXPECTED IMC' SET IN. IT CAUGHT ME COMPLETELY OFF GUARD WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO MY UNEASE. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I ACTUALLY FELT 'PRESSURED' AS A COMMERCIAL PLT. I CORRECTED THE SIT BY PROMPTLY CONTACTING THE APPROPRIATE ATC FACILITY AND CONFIGURING THE AIRPLANE FOR THE APCH. AFTER ALL; I AM A COMPETENT INST PLT. IN THE FUTURE; I WILL BE SURE TO PERFORM MORE THOROUGH FLT PLANNING. ALSO; AS A STANDARD OPERATING PRACTICE; I WILL PREPARE AN IFR PLAN (EVEN IN VMC) SO THAT I AM NEVER CAUGHT IN THIS PREDICAMENT AGAIN.

THE WX WAS 1900 FT OVCST. THE ILS APCH WAS IN USE. THE ARR RATE WAS HIGH. I WAS WORKING THE SNA ARR SECTOR. I DID NOT HAVE A HDOF/ASSISTANT PLUGGED IN DUE TO STAFFING ISSUES. THESE ARE THE FOLLOWING COMPLICATIONS OF WORKING THE SNA ARR SECTOR: 1) HIGH TERRAIN TO THE E. THE MVA'S MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO GET THE ACFT DOWN IN A TIMELY ENOUGH MANNER TO TURN THEM ONTO THE FINAL FROM THE E; INSTEAD OF TAKING THEM ACROSS AND PUTTING THEM ON A R DOWNWIND. AND; YOU REALLY CANNOT USE THIS AIRSPACE TO THE E BELOW 5000 FT. 2) THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY ONLY 3 USABLE IFR ALTS (3000 FT; 4000 FT; AND 5000 FT). ON THE R DOWNWIND; IF YOUR TFC IS NOT SITUATED EXACTLY 3 MI W OF THE FINAL AND 1.5 MI FROM THE ADJACENT SECTOR TO THE W; YOU WILL HAVE AN OPERROR. WHEN THE SECTOR IS BUSY IT IS CHALLENGING TO KEEP ALL ACFT 3 MI OR 1000 FT APART (STANDARD IFR SEPARATION). 3) THE SECTOR IS EXTREMELY COMPACT. IT OWNS APPROX 15 MI OF AIRSPACE TO THE N; MAINLY DUE TO THE LAX FINAL. WHEN THE ARR RATE IS HIGH; YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO PUT THE ACFT. IF THE ARPT IS ADVERTISING ILS APCHS DUE TO WX; NOW YOU ARE FORCED TO MIX ALL SMALL ACFT WITH JET/TURBOPROP ACFT AND PUT THEM ON YOUR FINAL. WAKE TURB SEPARATION INCREASES THE SPACING ON FINAL. SO; FOR EXAMPLE; THE OPTIMAL FINAL COULD HOLD NO MORE THAN 5 ACFT. INSIDE THE OM; WE CAN GO DOWN TO 2.5 NM SEPARATION BTWN LIKE ACFT; THEN 3 MI SEPARATION OUTSIDE THE OM. THAT IS 5 LIKE ACFT ON THE FINAL; AS LONG AS THEY ARE ALL GOING THE EXACT SAME SPD; AND THERE ARE NO WAKE TURB ISSUES. NOW; LOOK AT A SCENARIO WITH A B757; AND A PA28. THE PA28 NEEDS 5 MI MINIMUM BEHIND THE B757. AND OBVIOUSLY; IF YOU HAVE A C172 DOING 100 KTS AND 5 JETS BEHIND HIM; EVEN SLOWED TO THE MINIMUM SPDS; YOU NEED AT LEAST 6-8 MI BEHIND THAT C172; BECAUSE OF THE CLOSURE RATE. I AM SURE YOU GET THE POINT. 4) YOU HAVE ACFT COMING INTO THE SECTOR FROM EVERY DIRECTION. THE JET/TURBOPROP ACFT COME INBOUND OVER KAYOH INTXN FROM THE E AT 5200 FT AND 190 KTS. SMALL ACFT FROM THE SE FOR SNA AT 5000 FT ON A VECTOR TO THE OM; OR ON A V363 RTE AT 5000 FT TRANSITIONING THE AIRSPACE. JET/TURBOPROP ACFT FROM THE SW ON A R DOWNWIND AT 5000 FT THAT SHOULD BE DOING 200 KTS BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDER CLASS B AIRSPACE. ALL SMALL ACFT DEPARTING SNA TO THE N VIA V363; V8; V21; LHS; CLBING NW OFF THE ARPT TO 3000 FT. YOU NEED TO GET THESE ACFT UP AND ON THEIR WAY THROUGH YOUR R DOWNWIND TFC THAT NEEDS TO DSND. FROM W OVER SLI LNDG SNA AT 4000 FT OR VIA V8 ROUTING AT 5000 FT. RECIPE FOR DISASTER; 5000 FT TFC IS ON CONVERGING COURSES; AND ACFT E OF SLI DROP OFF YOUR SCOPE FOR 30 SECONDS OR MORE DUE TO THESE ACFT FLYING INTO THE RADAR ANTENNAE MAIN BANG. FROM THE N YOU GET JETS INBOUND VIA V363 AT 4000 FT AND 210 KTS (IF YOU'RE LUCKY) AND THEY SHOW UP WITHOUT WARNING; PRACTICALLY RIGHT ON YOUR FINAL. ALSO; FROM THE N YOU GET SMALL ACFT LNDG LGB; FUL; AND TOA AT 4000 FT HDG S. YOU ALSO GET FUL DEPS LNDG SNA; GOING SE AND NE CLBING TO 3000 FT. NOW; LET ME DESCRIBE THE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED WITH ACFT X AND A LEARJET INBOUND FROM THE N ON A V363 RTE AT 4000 FT AND 210 KTS. ACFT X WAS ON R DOWNWIND OUT OF 5000 FT FOR 4000 FT. THERE WAS A BE90 DOING E/W TURNS DROPPING FLIES AT 3500 FT VFR; INTERFERING WITH R DOWNWIND; R/L BASE AND THE FINAL. NORMALLY ACFT X WOULD HAVE BEEN DSNDED TO 3000 FT; BUT HAD TO STAY AT 4000 FT FOR THE BE90. POMONA SECTOR CALLED ME WITH A HDOF FROM THE N. I INSTRUCTED THE CTLR TO HAVE HIM FLY HDG 170 DEGS AND REDUCE SPD 170 KTS. AT THE TIME OF THE INSTRUCTION; THE LEAR APPEARED TO BE ON THE PRESCRIBED HDOF; WHICH WOULD BE OFF THE POM 164 DEG RADIAL. MY PLAN WAS TO EXTEND ACFT X ON DOWNWIND AND PUT THE LEAR ON FINAL AHEAD. I NOTICED THE LEAR HDG WBOUND; SO I CALLED POMONA SECTOR AND POINTED OUT ACFT X HDG 360 DEGS; AND ASKED; 'IS THAT LEAR TURNING?' AND AS I KEYED UP; THE CTLR WAS SAYING TO THE LEAR; 'EXPEDITE TURN.' AT THIS POINT IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE LEAR WAS NOT ON THE CORRECT RTE/HDG. I CALLED TFC TO ACFT X; 1 O'CLOCK POS; 4 MI; TURNING SEBOUND; 4000 FT. POMONA SAID I COULD DSND THE ACFT X TO 3000 FT; SO I STARTED HIM DOWN. ACFT X GOT THE LEAR IN SIGHT AND I ADVISED THE PLT HE WOULD FOLLOW THAT TFC INBOUND TO THE ARPT AND TO MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION WITH THAT TFC. AT THE TIME I BELIEVED I HAD VISUAL SEPARATION PRIOR TO LOSING STANDARD SEPARATION. I AM NOW SECOND-GUESSING THAT AND BELIEVE I MAY HAVE NOT HAD IT IN TIME. THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED BECAUSE OF A BREAKDOWN IN COM BTWN THE CTLRS. BE90 WAS A DISTRACTER; AND HAVING A HDOF THERE TO COORD AND A SECOND SET OF EYES COULD HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL. I HAD BEEN ON POS FOR APPROX 1 HR 15 MINS; WORKING MODERATE TO HVY TFC WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY. I AM NOT TELLING THIS STORY TO JUSTIFY WHAT HAPPENED; I AM TELLING THIS STORY SO THAT PLTS MAY GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH ON THE ATC SIDE.",,,,"SCT CTLR DESCRIBES WORK ENVIRONMENT AND CLOSE SEPARATION ERROR AT 4000 FT.",

AS WE PREPARED FOR TKOF; OUR FE COMPUTED OUR TKOF PERFORMANCE USING DATA PROVIDED HIM VIA THE ARPT'S ATIS. ATIS INFORMED US THE DEPARTING RWY WOULD BE RWY 17L. WHEN WE CONTACTED GND CTL; WE WERE TOLD TO STAND BY. WE STOOD BY MONITORING GND CTL AND HEARD ACR Y CALL AND REQUEST TAXI. GND INFORMED ACR Y THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS OF TURNING THE ARPT AROUND. FE THEN PICKED UP THE UPDATED ATIS BROADCAST. HE NOTED THAT THE WINDS HAD SHIFTED AND THE ARPT WAS USING RWY 34R FOR DEPS. THERE WAS NO MENTION ON THE ATIS REQUIRING ACFT DEPARTING RWY 34R TO TAXI FORWARD FROM THE NORMAL RWY ENTRY POINT TO THE DISPLACED THRESHOLD BEFORE APPLYING TKOF PWR. AFTER A SHORT WAIT; GND CTL CALLED US BACK AND ASKED IF WE WERE READY TO TAXI. WE ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND WERE TOLD TO TAXI UP TO RWY 34R AND WE WOULD BE FOLLOWING THE SECOND REGIONAL JET FOR TKOF. WE OBSERVED THE 2 RJ'S TAKE OFF AND MONITORED TWR'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THEM. AT NO TIME DID WE HEARD TWR INSTRUCT THE 2 PRIOR DEPS TO TAXI FORWARD PRIOR TO APPLYING TKOF PWR. AFTER THE 2 RJ'S HAD TAKEN OFF; WE WERE GIVEN TKOF CLRNC. WE WERE NOT INSTRUCTED TO TAXI FORWARD PRIOR TO APPLYING TKOF PWR. WE APPLIED TKOF PWR; AND MADE A NORMAL TKOF. WE WERE INFORMED LATER THAT DAY; OUR PWR-UP FOR TKOF BLEW OVER CONSTRUCTION BARRICADES AND 'MADE QUITE A MESS.' WE FLEW THE SAME FLT THE REMAINDER OF THE WK. EACH DAY; WE HEARD TWR INSTRUCT OTHER ACFT DEPARTING RWY 34R TO TAXI FORWARD TO THE DISPLACED THRESHOLD PRIOR TO APPLYING TKOF PWR; AND NOTED TWR INSTRUCTED US TO DO THE SAME. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT; IF A TEMPORARY SPECIAL PROC IS TO BE USED; THE ARPT BROADCAST THAT PROC OVER THE ATIS. THIS INFO WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO US VIA THE NOTAMS WE RECEIVED. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 662973: NOTAMS INDICATED A DISPLACED THRESHOLD FOR RWY 34R. THE TKOF DATA COMPUTED BY THE SO DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DISPLACED THRESHOLD. I HAD HIM CORRECT THE DATA WHICH CHANGED THE V1 SPD AND STOP DISTANCE. THE CAPT WAS AWARE OF THESE CHANGES AND THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE DISPLACED THRESHOLD. WHEN WE WERE CLRED FOR TKOF BY SLC TWR; WE WERE NOT GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS TO TAXI UP TO THE DISPLACED THRESHOLD FOR TKOF. HOWEVER; I ASSUMED THE CAPT WOULD TAXI UP TO THE DISPLACED THRESHOLD BECAUSE WE HAD JUST DISCUSSED IT. INSTEAD; HE BEGAN TO ADD PWR AFTER ALIGNING FOR TKOF. AT FIRST; I THOUGHT HE WAS ADDING ONLY ENOUGH TO TAXI DOWN THE RWY. WHEN HE ADDED MORE PWR; I QUESTIONED HIM IF HE WAS GOING TO WAIT UNTIL THE DISPLACED THRESHOLD. HE MUMBLED SOMETHING I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND AND WHILE ADDING STILL MORE PWR; TOLD ME I HAD THE ACFT (IT WAS MY TKOF). BY THIS TIME; WE WERE APCHING THE DISPLACED THRESHOLD. I WAITED UNTIL THEN TO CALL FOR STANDARD PWR. WHILE I FEEL PWR WAS ADDED EARLY; I DID NOT REALIZE THAT EXCESSIVE PWR WAS USED EARLY ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE BARRICADES TO BE BLOWN OVER.",,,,"DC10 BLOWS OVER BARRICADE BEHIND DISPLACED THRESHOLD ON TKOF FROM RWY 34R AT SLC.",

WAS TOLD BY TWR TO CROSS N SHORE OF COOK INLET 'AT OR ABOUT 1600 FT.' CHOSE TO PUT TOUCHDOWN ZONE ELEVATION IN ALT WINDOW AT GS CAPTURE VERSUS 1600 FT DUE TO FALSELY THINKING THAT TWR WOULD NOT FORCE US INTO AN ABOVE GS CONDITION AND FAILING TO NOTICE THAT THAT CLRNC WOULD PUT US ABOUT 300-400 FT ABOVE GS AT THE SHORELINE; THUS I SAW NO URGENCY TO CHANGE MY DSCNT/SPD PROFILE. CAPTURED GS AT ABOUT 3000 FT; APPROX 5 NM FROM KANSY AT ABOUT 210 KTS (STILL FEELING THAT I WOULD HAVE TIME TO SLOW AND FINISH CONFIGURING FOR LNDG). REDUCED DSCNT RATE TO TRACK GS AND TO SLOW BUT FAILED; INITIALLY; TO NOTICE THAT AUTOTHROTTLE HAD ENGAGED UPON GS CAPTURE AND THAT SPD WASN'T DECREASING BELOW THE 200 KTS IN THE SPD WINDOW. PNF MADE COMMENT THAT I WAS LOW JUST PRIOR TO KANSY AND I REALIZED THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN THE ALT RESTR PLACED ON US BY TWR AND SAW THAT I WAS DSNDING THROUGH APPROX 1500 FT; I SLOWED THE DSCNT BUT FAILED TO STOP IT XING THE SHORELINE APPROX 250 FT LOW. SOMEWHERE IN THERE; I REALIZED THAT SPD WAS NOT SLOWING; DISCONNECTED AUTOTHROTTLE AND PULLED PWR TO IDLE AND ASKED FOR 'FLAPS TO 5 DEGS' AND 'GEAR DOWN; FINAL DSCNT CHKLIST.' I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CONFIGN TO FLAPS 25 DEGS AT ABOUT 160 KTS BUT GOT HIGH ON THE GLIDE PATH. DECIDED TO USE SPD BRAKES AT THIS POINT TO ASSIST IN DSCNT/DECELERATION. FAILED TO MONITOR DSCNT RATE ADEQUATELY AS I WAS FOCUSING ON GETTING SPD DOWN. HEARD PNF CALL 'WATCH DSCNT RATE' WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY A 'SINK RATE' GPWS. DSCNT RATE AT THIS POINT WAS ABOUT 1800-2000 FPM AT ABOUT 2 NM FROM THE RWY AND ABOUT 700 FT RADIO ALTIMETER. SPD BRAKE WAS STOWED AND DSCNT RATE IMMEDIATELY ARRESTED AS I PREPARED TO EXECUTE A GAR. NOT HEARING A CONFIRMING CALL FROM PNF TO EXECUTE A GAR AND MOVING BACK ONTO GS I CONTINUED MY DSCNT AND FINISHED CONFIGURING AND SLOWING FOR LNDG. BY APPROX 400 FT RADIO ALTIMETER; WAS WITHIN STABILIZED APCH CRITERIA. IN VMC; I TEND TO FLY MOST OF MY APCHS ON THE SLIGHTLY 'AGGRESSIVE' SIDE; TRYING NOT TO GET MYSELF INTO A LOW; SLOW; DRAG-IT-IN SITUATION IN HOPES OF BEING MORE FUEL EFFICIENT. EARLY IN MY B757 CAREER THAT WOULD RESULT IN SOME HIGH; FAST APCHS. AS MY EXPERIENCE IN THIS ACFT INCREASED; I HAD BEEN DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB OF USING NORMAL CONFIGN CHANGES WITH OCCASIONAL USE OF SPD BRAKES TO BLEED OFF EXCESS SPD AND/OR ALT. ON THIS DATE; I FAILED TO SEE AND REACT PROPERLY TO SEVERAL FACTORS WHICH ULTIMATELY PUT ME INTO A HIGH AND FAST POS. I THEN; IMPROPERLY; ATTEMPTED TO 'SAVE THE DAY' BY USING SPD BRAKES BELOW THE 'LIMIT' ALT (NOT KNOWINGLY; AT THIS POINT MY SITUATIONAL AWARENESS HAD DETERIORATED ENOUGH TO NOT REALIZE JUST HOW LOW I WAS) RESULTING IN THE GPWS WARNING. TO TOP IT OFF; I FAILED TO MAINTAIN AN ATC ASSIGNED ALT RESTR OR EXECUTE THE GAR THAT I KNEW WAS IN ORDER. WHY? WAS IT THE 3 HRS OF SLEEP THAT I HAD THE NIGHT BEFORE? WAS IT THAT WE WERE FINISHING UP AN ALMOST 10 HR DUTY DAY INCLUDING ABOUT 7.5 HRS OF FLT TIME? WAS IT THAT WE WERE ON DAY #4 OF A SCHEDULED 5 DAY TRIP? OR WAS I JUST BEING LAZY AND RELYING ON THE APCH TO BE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER? SADLY; I DO BELIEVE THAT EACH OF THESE CAUSES; AND PROBABLY SOME OTHERS; ULTIMATELY HAD AN EFFECT ON MY JUDGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING PROCESS. BETTER PLANNING; PROPER USE OF THE ALT WINDOW TO PROTECT IN AN ALT BUST; AN HONEST EVALUATION OF THE APCH AND EXECUTION OF A GAR WHEN NOT PROPERLY STABILIZED WERE IN ORDER ON THIS DATE AND ANY FUTURE DAY OF FLYING. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 663265: FO WAS FLYING A NICE APCH INTO ANC. HE HAS JUST ABOUT 2000 HRS AS AN FO ON THE B757. AT ABOUT 3500 FT; WE WERE CLRED FOR A VISUAL APCH TO RWY 14 WITH A RESTR TO CROSS THE N SHORE OF THE KNIK ARM INLET AT OR ABOVE 1600 FT. I MENTIONED TO THE FO THAT I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED THAT CLRNC HERE AND I DID NOT KNOW IF THAT WOULD PUT US ABOVE THE GS OR NOT. I FIGURED IT MIGHT. FO SAID HE WOULD KEEP AN EYE ON IT. HE WAS MAINTAININGABOUT 200 KTS DSNDING THROUGH 3000 FT. I FELT I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN TRYING TO GET THE PLANE PRELOADED WITH DRAG TO CROSS THE 1600 FT RESTR WITH GEAR DOWN AND 160 KTS. THE FO DID NOT MAKE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO BLEED THE SPD. IN FACT; HE SEEMED TO NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE SPD BELOW 200 KTS. APCHING THE 1600 FT RESTR; IT BECAME APPARENT TO ME THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO LEVEL OFF FROM THE GS IN ORDER TO MAKE THE RESTR. APCHING 1700 FT; I MENTIONED THAT HE WAS APCHING 1600 FT. ULTIMATELY; HE DID NOT LEVEL OFF AND CROSSED THE RESTR 250 FT LOW AT APPROX 185 KTS. AT ABOUT 1100 FT RADIO ALT; HE REALIZED THAT HIS SPD WAS NOT BLEEDING OFF FAST ENOUGH AND HE GRABBED FOR THE SPD BRAKE. HE WAS ABOUT 1/2 TO 1 FULL DOT HIGH ON THE GS AT THIS POINT. HE DID NOT ADJUST THE PITCH RAPIDLY ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN THE GS; AS HE PASSED THROUGH IT TO A DOT LOW BEFORE COMING BACK ONTO THE GS. HE DEVELOPED A HIGH ENOUGH SINK RATE TO GET A COUPLE 'SINK RATE' GPWS WARNINGS BEFORE THAT WAS CORRECTED AND BACK TO THE GS. HE WAS FINALLY IN WHAT I WOULD CALL A STABILIZED POS BY 300 FT. OBVIOUSLY; NOT ONLY DID WE MISS THE ALT RESTR THE TWR WANTED; THIS WAS A VERY UNSTABILIZED APCH. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE PUT INTO THIS POS AND WRITING A NARRATIVE OF THIS TYPE WHILE FLYING WITH SOMEONE I CONSIDERED FAIRLY EXPERIENCED IN THE ACFT. I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID NOT COMMAND A GAR. I KNOW IT CROSSED MY MIND AS HE WAS GRABBING FOR THE SPD BRAKES AT 1100 FT. I WAS THINKING IT WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO HIT THE GA SWITCHES ON THE THRUST LEVERS; BUT I JUST DID NOT GET THOSE WORDS OUT OF MY LIPS. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN MY PERFORMANCE AS THE CAPT OF THIS FLT. I WAS THE SAFETY VALVE AND I FAILED. AFTER HE STARTED THE HIGH SINK RATE; I FELT VERY TASK SATURATED TO GET THE ACFT BACK UNDER FLT PATH CTL. I THINK I WAS NOT MENTALLY PREPARED FOR A GAR EVEN THOUGH WE BRIEFED IT. MOST OF US THINK OF A GAR FROM IFR MINIMUMS; NOT ABOVE 1000 FT. I KNOW I WILL NEVER BE PUT INTO A SIMILAR SITUATION WITH THE SAME OUTCOME; A GAR IS A MUST.",,,,"FLT CREW OF B757-200 LAND OUT OF AN UNSTABILIZED APCH TO RWY 14 AT ANC.",

WITHOUT REALIZING IT; I ISSUED A DSCNT FROM 7000 FT TO 4000 FT. I INTENDED TO ISSUE 5000 FT AND MISSED THE PLT'S READBACK OF 4000 FT. I SAW THE ACFT DSNDING BELOW 5000 FT. I ASKED THE PLT TO CONFIRM LEVEL AT 5000 FT; AND WAS SURPRISED WHEN IT ADVISED IT HAD BEEN ISSUED 4000 FT. I THEN ISSUED 5000 FT AND THE ACFT CLBED BACK UP. THIS IS AN ERROR BECAUSE THE MVA IN THE ACFT'S AREA IS 5000 FT. THIS RESULTED IN A LOSS OF SEPARATION WITH TERRAIN. NO ALT ALERT OCCURRED. THIS PROB OCCURRED BECAUSE I BECAME PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ABNORMAL SIT. THE B190 WAS IN AN AREA TO DSND TO 4000 FT. I THINK THAT WHEN THE C208 CHKED ON; I WAS IN A HURRY TO GIVE HIM AN INSTRUCTION AND GET BACK TO SEPARATING OTHER ACFT. AS A RESULT; I INADVERTENTLY GAVE THE C208 THE ALT I WAS PLANNING ON ISSUING TO THE OTHER ACFT. I ALSO DID NOT FULLY PAY ATTN TO THE PLT'S READBACK. THE CTLR WORKING WITH ME ADVISED ME AFTERWARD THAT HE DID NOT HEAR ANY OF MY CONVERSATION WITH THE C208 BECAUSE HE WAS OCCUPIED ORGANIZING THE INBOUND FLT STRIPS. IF WE BOTH HAD BEEN PAYING A LITTLE MORE ATTN; THIS ERROR COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. FACTORS AFFECTING THE QUALITY OF HUMAN PERFORMANCE: IT WAS MY SECOND DAY BACK FROM A 1 1/2 WK VACATION; AND I FELT A LITTLE 'RUSTY' ON THAT POS. THE OTHER CTLR HAS ONLY BEEN AN FPL FOR 1 MONTH AND I BELIEVE IT WAS HIS FIRST TIME WORKING THE HDOF POS BY HIMSELF. THIS POS USUALLY IS COMBINED WITH THE ONE I WAS WORKING DURING TRAINING RESULTING IN A LACK OF REAL PROFICIENCY ON IT (IN MY OPINION).",,,,"FAI CTLR EXPERIENCED OPERROR WHEN AN ALT; BELOW MVA; WAS ISSUED AND A CLRNC READBACK WAS MISSED.",

SIGNIFICANT CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WAS PRESENT TO THE NE; E; SE; AND S. TO THE W AND SW CUMULUS CLOUDS WERE BUILDING IN TYPICAL SUMMER MIDWEST FASHION. APPROX 50 DME SW OF CVG VOR; ATC BEGAN ISSUING VECTORS FOR TFC AVOIDANCE. AT FIRST THEY ISSUED A DESCENT TO 7000 FT. WITH SCATTERED TO BROKEN CUMULUS PRESENT; PLUS TURB I TOLD ATC I WAS UNABLE TO COMPLY DUE TO WEATHER. A DESCENT TO A LOWER ALT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE AT THE LEAST AND HAZARDOUS AT THE MOST FOR MYSELF AND MY THREE PAX. AS AN ALTERNATE I INFORMED ATC I COULD ACCEPT AN OFF COURSE VECTOR. THE CTLR CAME BACK WITH AN EASTERLY HDG. WITH A SOLID LINE OF CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY FROM THE SW TO THE NE; THIS TOO WAS UNACCEPTABLE. I TOLD THE CTLR A L TURN WOULD KEEP ME CLR OF THE WX AND HE SAID 'FINE; TURN L TO A HDG OF 160 DEGS.' I'VE HAD SOME OFF-COURSE VECTORS BEFORE; BUT NEVER 230 DEGS AND CERTAINLY NOT INTO CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY. I INFORMED HIM I COULD NOT ACCEPT THIS AND HE BECAME PANICKY STATING 'YOU'RE GONNA CRASH INTO ANOTHER AIRPLANE.' I CALMLY REPLIED 'NOBODY IS GOING TO CRASH INTO ANYBODY.' VISIBILITY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TFC (NW) WAS UNRESTRICTED. I WAS NEVER ABLE TO VISUALLY ACQUIRE ANY TFC AND THERE WAS NO LOSS OF SEPARATION OR SAFETY ISSUE. AS FAR AS THE LATTER IS CONCERNED; THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID HAD I ACCEPTED THE INANE VECTORS TO FLY THROUGH THE THUNDERSTORMS. I HAVE READ TOO MANY ACCIDENT RPTS THAT STATE 'WITNESSES OBSERVED ACFT FALLING FROM SKY MINUS WINGS' AND THE LIKE. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS INCLUDE: THE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY IN AND AROUND THE APCH AND DEP CORRIDORS SURROUNDING CVG; FREQUENCY CONGESTION LEADING TO PARTIAL TRANSMISSIONS AND/OR REPLIES; AND MOST SIGNIFICANTLY; THE RELATIVE INEXPERIENCE OF SOME OF THE RADAR CTLRS IN THIS SECTOR. ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR ANY AMOUNT OF TIME RECOGNIZES A ROOKIE AND MAKES ALLOWANCES FOR THESE PLTS/CTLRS. PERHAPS IT IS A LACK OF APPRECIATION OF OPS AROUND SIGNIFICANT METEOROLOGICAL EVENTS; OR THE INABILITY OF ATC TO 'SEE' THE WEATHER. IN ANY CASE; I WOULD BE LAX IN MY PLT-IN-COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES IF I ALLOWED ATC TO PUT MY PAX AND ACFT IN A SIT WHERE THERE WAS A GREAT PROBABILITY OF GRAVE DANGER. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: PLT STATED THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE FLOWN HIS ACFT INTO THAT PARTICULAR WEATHER EVEN IF HIS CARGO WAS FREIGHT; MUCH LESS HUMANS.

FREEZING LEVEL WAS FORECAST NEAR 5000 FT MSL. NORMAL IFR RTE IS CLB TO 6000 FT AND FLY DOWN V25 ALONG THE SPINE OF THE COASTAL MOUNTAINS WHICH WERE CLOUDED OVER. GIVEN THE OROGRAPHIC LIFT AND FREEZING LEVEL; I HAD CONCERNS ABOUT ICING AND DIDN'T WANT TO TRY TO 'OUT CLB' IT WITH A NORMALLY ASPIRATED ENG. FROM THE ARPT I COULD SEE DOWN THE VALLEY ALONG THE DIRECT RTE TOWARD ZZZ2 AND THE BOTTOMS OF THE CLOUDS WERE WELL ILLUMINATED BY THE CITY LIGHTS. I DEPARTED VFR AND PROCEEDED SW AT ABOUT 2500 FT UNTIL APCHING THE HILLS AT THE RESERVOIR. AT THAT POINT; I COULD SEE THE LIGHTS A CITY BELOW THE CLOUDS AND ABOVE THE HILLS; ALTHOUGH I NEEDED TO CLB A BIT TO RETAIN GND CLRNC -- ESPECIALLY WITH THE DARK HILLS MORE DIFFICULT TO DISCERN. AS I PROCEEDED TOWARD THE CLEARLY VISIBLE LIGHTS; THEY QUICKLY VANISHED AND I REALIZED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF UNCONSCIOUS PULLING ON THE STICK AND A FALLING CEILING I'D ENTERED THE BASES OF THE CLOUDS. I IMMEDIATELY EXECUTED A 180 DEG R TURN BUT IN THE TURN REALIZED 4 SCARY THINGS: 1) I HADN'T CHKED MY HDG BEFORE STARTING THE TURN AND WAS FLUSTERED ENOUGH NOT TO BE SURE WHERE I SHOULD ROLL OUT. 2) I HAD CLBED A BIT MORE IN THE TURN AND SO MIGHT NOT POP INTO VMC AT THE POINT I LEFT IT. 3) THERE WAS A BIG HILL TO MY R THAT I THOUGHT I HAD ALT TO CLR BUT WASN'T POSITIVE. 4) I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT MY TURN RADIUS WOULD BE. TO REGAIN SITUATIONAL AWARENESS; I LOOKED AT MY 430'S MOVING MAP BUT THE IMAGE WAS CONFUSING AND IT TOOK SEVERAL SECONDS TO DECIDE TO POINT THE AIRPLANE AT THE DEPICTION OF ZZZ3. THE CONFUSION RESULTED FROM THE FACT THAT MY 430 IS CONFIGURED FOR 'DESIRE TRACK UP' WHICH WORKS VERY WELL IN MOST IFR OPS. I HAD NEVER TRIED TO USE THE 430 TO NAV 'BACKWARDS;' HOWEVER; AND I WAS MOMENTARILY CONFUSED BY SEEING THE AIRPLANE ICON FLYING TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. THIS PRESENTATION ALSO SEVERELY LIMITED THE AMOUNT OF MAP INFO 'IN FRONT' OF ME SINCE THE PRESENT POS IS DRAWN ABOUT 80% OF THE WAY DOWN THE SCREEN. ONCE I REGAINED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS; I REALIZED I WAS IN A TIGHT HOLE BTWN HILLS; CLOUDS; AND CLASS C AIRSPACE. I TRIED TO CONTACT APCH FOR A POP-UP IFR CLRNC BUT GOT NO RESPONSE ON ONE FREQ AND TOLD TO CONTACT THE FIRST FREQ WHEN I CALLED A SECOND FREQ. I FINALLY ELECTED TO PROCEED DOWN THE VALLEY TOWARD ZZZ3 TO GET AWAY FROM THE CLASS C AIRSPACE SINCE APCH WOULDN'T RESPOND AND GO AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAINS. AS SOON AS I STARTED MOVING SE; THOUGH I SAW CLR SKY ABOVE ME AND CLBED THROUGH A HOLE ON TOP OF WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY THIN LAYER AT WHICH POINT THE FLT CONTINUED UNEVENTFULLY. IN HINDSIGHT; THE IMPROPERLY PLANNED AND EXECUTED 180 DEG TURN IN THE CLOUDS WAS PROBABLY THE HIGHEST RISK ELEMENT OF THE FLT. HAD I FILED IFR; THE CHANCES ARE HIGH THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY ICE; AND IF THERE WERE; I COULD TURN L OR R TO REACH LOWER TERRAIN AND DSND. ONCE ENCOUNTERING IMC; HAD I CLBED EVEN A FEW HUNDRED FT OR PROCEEDED STRAIGHT AHEAD FOR A FEW MI; I WOULD HAVE RE-ENTERED VMC WITH NO TERRAIN HAZARD. IT MAKES ME WONDER IF THE UNCONDITIONAL 'TURN AROUND IF YOU ENTER IMC' ADVICE SO OFTEN GIVEN TO VFR PLTS IS ACTUALLY SAFEST. AS IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE CASE; THINKING FOR A FEW SECONDS AND MAKING A PLAN 'BEFORE' EXECUTING IT WOULD GO A LONG WAY. GIVING CONSIDERATION TO CLBING TO REACH VMC; ESPECIALLY WHEN STRATUS IS INVOLVED WOULD BE PRUDENT. IN THIS CASE; AND I WOULD EXPECT NEARLY ALWAYS; THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS PUSHING A PLT TOWARD THE EDGE OF A VFR INTO IMC SIT AND THOSE FACTORS MAY WELL BE MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CLOUDS THEMSELVES. OBVIOUSLY; I SHOULD HAVE BROKEN THE CHAIN OF EVENTS SOONER THAN I DID AND IN THE FUTURE I WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO RECOGNIZE AND MAINTAIN PROPER CLOUD CLRNC; OR AVOID THE SIT ENTIRELY.",,,,"A VFR RV6A PLT ENTERED IMC NEAR MOUNTAINS AND EXECUTED TURN TO REGAIN VMC WHILE ATTEMPTING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO CONTACT ATC.",

I WAS FLT ATTENDANT #7 SITTING AT 4L. IN ACCORDANCE WITH MY FLT ATTENDANT'S MANUAL; I PERFORMED MY PREFLT SAFETY INSPECTION. IN THE COURSE OF THOSE CHKS; I NOTICED THAT THE DOOR PRESSURE GAUGE WAS NOT IN THE GREEN BAND. IN FACT; THE YELLOW NEEDLE CLEARLY HAD PORTIONS OF THE RED BAND ON EITHER SIDE. I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE PURSER; WHO THEN REQUESTED A MECHANIC. WHEN THE MECHANIC ARRIVED; HE LOOKED AT THE GAUGE AND REMARKED; 'MAKE YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE.' HE LEFT TO TEND TO THE ISSUE. SHORTLY AFTERWARD; THE FO CAME BACK TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF AND TO LOOK ON THE FLT ATTENDANT VIEW PANEL. I EXPLAINED THE PROB TO HIM AND ASKED HIM TO RELAY THE ISSUE TO THE CAPT. A SHORT TIME LATER; THE MECHANIC RETURNED WITH ANOTHER MECHANIC (PERHAPS A FOREMAN) WHO THEN LOOKED AT THE GAUGE. HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NEEDLE WAS NOT IN THE GREEN BAND AS REQUIRED AND STATED; 'WE DON'T HAVE ANY SLIDES HERE.' HE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT THERE IS A NEW AGREEMENT BETWEEN ACR X AND THE FAA THAT PERMITS ACR X TO ALLOW THE FLT TO BE DISCHARGED WITH A DOOR PRESSURE GAUGE OUTSIDE OF THE GREEN BAND SO LONG AS THE FLT IS ON THE GND FOR LESS THAN TWO HOURS. APPARENTLY; THE TWO HOURS IS MEANT TO ALLOW A COLD DOOR PRESSURE BOTTLE TO ACCLIMATE TO THE AMBIENT TEMP THUS RENDERING AN ACCURATE READING. THE TEMP ON THIS DAY WAS 97 DEGS AND A HEAT WARNING HAD BEEN ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL WX SVC. IN MY VIEW THE BOTTLE WOULD HAVE REACHED AMBIENT TEMP VERY QUICKLY IN THIS HEAT. SINCE I HAD DEALT WITH THIS VERY SAME ISSUE WEEKS PREVIOUSLY ON THE ZZZZ FLT; I KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AGREEMENT AND ASKED HIM HOW LONG IT HAD BEEN IN EFFECT. HE STATED THAT IT HAD BEEN ABOUT TWO MONTHS. SINCE THE PLANE HAD BEEN ON THE GND LESS THAN TWO HOURS; HE FELT THAT THE ACFT WOULD PROBABLY BE DISCHARGED. I POINTED OUT THAT THE ACFT WOULD HAVE MUCH MORE THAN TWO HOURS ON THE GND IN ZZZZ1 AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ANY REPLACEMENT SLIDES AVAILABLE THERE EITHER. HE STATED THAT THAT WAS UP TO THE MECHANICS IN ZZZZ1 AND THAT PERHAPS ONE COULD BE FLOWN IN THERE. I TOLD HIM THAT IF THE PLANE WAS DISCHARGED; THAT IT WOULD LIKELY RETURN IN THE SAME UNSAFE CONDITION. A FEW MOMENTS AFTER THEY LEFT; I CALLED THE PURSER; AND ASKED TO FIND OUT FROM THE COCKPIT WHAT TIME THE PLANE HAD LANDED. AFTER CHKING WITH THE CAPT; I WAS TOLD THAT THE PLANE LANDED AT XA:15. AFTER DISCUSSING THIS WITH ANOTHER FLT ATTENDANT; WE REALIZED THAT WITH OUR DEP TIME SCHEDULED AT XC:20; THE GND TIME WOULD BE 2:05; FIVE MINUTES OVER THE TIME ALLOWED BY THE FAA. I THEN CALLED THE COCKPIT AND SPOKE WITH THE CAPT. HE STATED THAT HE WOULD COME BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE DOOR. WHEN HE ARRIVED; HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE YELLOW NEEDLE WAS NOT IN THE GREEN BAND AND STATED THAT THERE WERE NO SLIDES IN STOCK THAT COULD BE USED AS A REPLACEMENT. I POINTED OUT THAT THE PLANE COULD GO WITH AN INOPERABLE DOOR SO LONG AS THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF PAX WERE MOVED AWAY FROM THE AREA. THE REQUIREMENTS ARE SPELLED OUT IN DETAIL IN OUR FLT ATTENDANT MANUAL; AND DATE BACK TO JANUARY/SAT/2005. I TOLD HIM THAT THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE WAS TO REPLACE THE SLIDE BUT THAT I DID NOT HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS SUFFICIENT AIR IN THE BOTTLE TO FULLY INFLATE THE SLIDE IN AN EMER EVACUATION. I POINTED OUT THAT THE FLT WAS FULLY LOADED WITH PAX AND REPEATEDLY STATED MY CONCERNS ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF THE SLIDE SHOULD AN EVACUATION BE REQUIRED. I MENTIONED THE GND TIME IN ZZZZ1 AND THAT THE ISSUE WOULD HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED THERE; WHICH MIGHT RESULT IN A CANCELLATION OR LENGTHY DELAY. HE LISTENED TO MY CONCERNS AND THEN RETURNED TO THE COCKPIT. AS DEP TIME APCHED; IT BECAME CLR THAT NO ACTION WAS GOING TO BE TAKEN. I TELEPHONED ONBOARD SVCS SUPVR ON MY CELL PHONE TO EXPRESS MY CONCERNS. SVCS SUPVR PLACED ME ON HOLD AND CALLED MAINT. THEY TOLD THE SVCS SUPVR THAT THEY 'FELT' THE SLIDE WAS OK; AS DID THE CAPT. NO OBJECTIVE CRITERIA WAS OFFERED ALLOWING THE ACFT TO BE DISPATCHED. AT NO POINT DID ANYONE INDICATE THAT MOVING PAX FROM THEAREA WAS BEING CONSIDERED; NOR DID ANYONE SUGGEST THAT THE SLIDE WOULD BE REPLACED. INSTEAD; THE ONLY REACTION I HEARD WAS THAT 'NO REPLACEMENT SLIDE WAS AVAILABLE' REGARDLESS OF THE GND TIME AND NO ONE HAD ANY INTEREST IN TAKING ONE FROM ANOTHER ACFT OR SWITCHING ACFT. IT WAS CLR AT THAT POINT THAT ACR INTENDED TO DISPATCH THE ACFT WITH A DOOR INFLATION BOTTLE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE CAPABLE OF INFLATING THE EVACUATION SLIDE FULLY. RATHER THAN RUN THAT RISK; I CHOSE TO DISEMBARK THE ACFT. THE FLT DEPARTED WITHOUT ME. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER; I HAD THE SAME SIT THREE WEEKS AGO ON A FLT TO ZZZZ. IN THAT INSTANCE; THE DOOR WAS 4R. THE NEEDLE WAS IN THE EXACT SAME POSITION WITH RED CLEARLY VISIBLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE NEEDLE. SINCE THE PLANE WAS ON THE GND FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS; I WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC THEN THAT THE SLIDE WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED. THE CAPT ON THAT FLT HAD LOOKED AT THE GAUGE; DECLARED IT OK; AND WAS OVERRIDDEN BY THE MECHANIC FOREMAN WHO EXPLAINED THE PROC. THAT IS WHEN I FIRST HEARD OF THIS TWO HOUR AGREEMENT WITH THE FAA. WHAT; THEN; ACCOUNTS FOR THE DIFFERENT RESULTS WITH TWO IDENTICAL SLIDE PRESSURE GAUGES AND GND TIMES GREATER THAN TWO HOURS? HOW CAN A CAPT SAY A SLIDE IS OK WHEN IT CLEARLY IS NOT? TO MY KNOWLEDGE; THIS ACFT HAS NOW MADE THREE TRANS-ATLANTIC CROSSINGS WITH THE DOOR SLIDE INDICATOR AT 4L OUTSIDE OF THE GREEN BAND; DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PLANE HAS HAD A GND TIME IN EXCESS OF TWO HOURS ON AT LEAST TWO OCCASIONS. IT IS MY HOPE THAT; IF THAT SLIDE IS NEEDED IN AN EVACUATION; THAT THERE WILL BE ENOUGH AIR IN THE DOOR BOTTLE TO INFLATE IT FULLY. HOPEFULLY; IT WILL GET REPLACED BEFORE WE FIND OUT. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THAT THE ESCAPE SLIDE BOTTLE PRESSURE INDICATOR YELLOW NEEDLE HAD RED ON EACH SIDE OF THE NEEDLE AND NO QUESTION THAT IT WAS OUT OF LIMITS. CHKING THE SLIDE BOTTLE PRESSURE IS PART OF PRE DEP CABIN CHK AND IS DONE BY THE HANDBOOK. THE OTHER DOOR SLIDE BOTTLE PRESSURES WERE ALL FOUND IN THE GREEN BAND.

BORESCOPE EXAM REVEALED CYLINDER DAMAGE THROUGHOUT OUR FLEET; AND FURTHER DISASSEMBLY REVEALED VARIOUS DEGREES OF DAMAGE INCLUDING SEVERELY OVERHEATED CONNECTING RODS AND DETONATION DAMAGE. THE FUEL PROVIDER AND PRODUCER WERE INVOLVED. THIS STARTED AN ONGOING EFFORT ON OUR PART TO DISCOVER EXACTLY WHAT HAS OCCURRED. FUEL SAMPLES HAVE BEEN ANALYZED AND FOUND TO BE OUT OF SPEC PER ASTM STANDARDS; PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO LEAD PRECIPITATE. OIL ANALYSIS HAS CONSISTENTLY SHOWN HIGH IRON OXIDE LEVELS. SOME ACFT HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO SVC AFTER ENG OR CYLINDER REPLACEMENT. OTHERS ARE STILL OTS. MY CONCERN HAS TO DO WITH POTENTIALLY EXPOSED ACFT BEING OPERATED WITHOUT THE OPERATOR'S KNOWLEDGE OF THESE EVENTS. THE FAA/FSDO WAS INVOLVED IN THIS INVESTIGATION; BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE NO SIGNIFICANT EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO NOTIFY OWNERS OF EXPOSED ACFT. IT IS MY FEELING THAT 2 PROBS EXIST: THE RUST WHICH CAUSED BLOCKING OF FUEL SYS COMPONENTS; AND THE FUEL QUALITY WITH UNDETERMINED EFFECTS. I CONTINUE TO HEAR OF AREA ACFT OWNERS WHO HAVE HAD RECENT MAINT DUE TO UNEXPLAINED LOSS OF CYLINDER COMPRESSION.

THE RPTR STATED THE FUEL SAMPLES WERE SENT TO 2 SEPARATE LABORATORIES FOR ANALYSIS AND BOTH INDICATED HIGHER LEAD PRECIPITATE; WHICH WHEN USED IN A SUPERCHARGED ENG; WILL ACTUALLY LOWER THE ANTI-KNOCK OCTANE RATING. THE RPTR INDICATED A NUMBER OF ACFT OWNERS WITH DAMAGED ENGS HAVE SETTLED WITH INSURANCE CARRIERS.

AT THAT TIME THE AIRPLANE WAS PUT BACK TOGETHER AND THE HGS SYS CONTINUED ON MEL. ENGINEERING WAS EVALUATING THE SIT AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH A FIX AND PLAN TO ACCOMPLISH IT DUE TO THE TIME IT WOULD REQUIRE. THIS AIRPLANE WAS GOING INTO A HVY CHK WHICH WAS A GOOD TIME TO ATTEMPT THE REPAIRS OF THE INTERCOSTAL. AFTER CONFERRING WITH THE STC HOLDER; IT WAS DETERMINED THAT REPLACEMENT OF THE INTERCOSTAL AND A RE-BORESIGHT OF THE HGS SYS FOR PROPER ALIGNMENT OF THE FORWARD OVERHEAD MOUNT BRACKET WOULD BE REQUIRED. SINCE THE B737-300 IS OUT OF PRODUCTION FOR BOEING; THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PIECE REQUIRED FOR REPLACEMENT. THEREFORE; WE WOULD HAVE TO MANUFACTURE THIS PIECE IN ORDER TO DO THE REPAIR.

A SWITCH TO TXK VOR (RAW DATA) SHOWED US ONE DOT L OF COURSE AT ABOUT 75 NM W OF TXK. AT THAT POINT WE USED VOR NAVIGATION FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE RNAV DEP. WE INFORMED ATC OF THIS. LATER; PASSING OVER TXK; THE FMS SHOWED WITHIN A MILE OR SO. I REALLY CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE DRIFT OFF COURSE. THE FMS SHOWED TRACKING CTRLINE. I ALWAYS CHK THE ACFT SYMBOL AT THE END OF THE RWY WHEN WE GO IN POSITION. I KNOW THE FMS STARTED OUT IN THE RIGHT POSITION. NO ONE MADE ANY INPUTS TO THE MANAGEMENT UNIT AFTER TKOF. THE FMS WASN'T IN DR MODE. WE WERE PICKING UP AN INCREASING WIND OFF THE L WING. EITHER THE DRIFT WAS PERHAPS CAUSED BY SOME ELECTRONIC INTERFERENCE FROM THE CABIN OR WAS ANOTHER MD80 ANOMALY. I HAVE SEEN RTE DISCONTINUITIES MYSTERIOUSLY SHOW UP WITH ELECTRICAL POWER SHIFTS AFTER R ENG STARTS; BUT NOTHING LIKE THIS. I LIKE TO USE RAW DATA FROM VORS TO CROSS CHK THE RNAV. HOWEVER; AT THE TIME ATC CALLED WE WERE BOTH STILL IN MAP MODE.

There was another C-172 ahead of me with a student and an instructor flying patterns. The other plane made a very long downwind. I called to him asking his intentions. He replied he was about to turn base. I then extended my downwind to accommodate his long downwind leg. I subsequently turned base when I thought it appropriate; given his position on final.  I believed I was allowing a reasonable distance behind him when I followed him into final.  He then landed and I was near the threshold and about 75 feet AGL when suddenly my plane moved over to the right about 50/75 feet. I corrected and continued my approach. Soon after I was back on the centerline and still descending when I found my plane off to the left side of the runway. I then aborted my approach and went around the pattern. At that time I realized that I had likely encountered his [wing tip] vortices; first one side; then the other. I was surprised because I always allow extra distance for larger aircraft ahead of me but; in this case; both planes were of similar size. I will always allow more distance when following another aircraft in the future. Even though he was clear of the runway before I would have landed; I still encountered his wing vortices.",,,,"A C172 Pilot executed a go-around following two encounters with the probable wake vortices from a preceding landing aircraft.",
